May 12, 2010   |Kevin Scott Varga #999368   |I am going to start with the victim&apos;s family. I know I took someone very precious to you. Myself and Mr. Galloway who you will see tomorrow. Please forgive me. God has given me peace. I love each and every one of you. You have to forgive me for you to gain the kingdom of Heaven. I wish what was torn from you was not. I do know how it feels to have lost loved ones. This was the only way God could save me; I would pay it back a thousand times to bring back your loved ones. I would pay it gladly. I love each and every one of you and hope you can find forgiveness for me. I don&apos;t require your forgiveness, because God has forgiven me. Sorry, I hope you find peace. God&apos;s love is infinite. If you hate me, please give it up. I forgive you and I hope you can forgive me. Mom, you are my strength. Kathy we&apos;ve had some good memories, you are still the monkey. Mom, this is nothing, I am going to go to sleep and wake up with Jesus. This is the only way God could save me. Stefanie, she is my heart, say goodbye to Stefanie. I do not want anybody to mourn my death, celebrate my life. God loves me and God loves you. Mom, you didn&apos;t do anything wrong. Thank you, Warden, Thank you Chaplain, Thank you God, I am ready to go. God please take me home. I am ready Warden. Thank you Jesus. I am going mom. 
 July 24, 2003|Allen Janecka #684| First of all, I want to say God bless everyone here today.  For many years I have done things my way, which caused a lot of pain to me, my family and many others.  Today I have come to realize that for peace and happiness, one has to do things God&apos;s way.  I want to thank my family for their support.  I love you.  I am taking you with me.  You all stay strong.  I love you.  I also want to say thanks to the Chaplains who I have met through the years and who have brought me a long way.  And I cherish you as my family and at this time...oh, Ken, my little son, I am coming to see you.  Oh Lord, into your hands I commit my spirit.  Thy will be done.  
November 19, 2002|Craig Ogan #979| I would like to say first of all the real violent crimes in this case are acts committed by James Boswell and Clay Morgan Gaines. We have the physical evidence to prove fabrication and cover-up. The people responsible for killing me will have blood on their hands for an unprovoked murder. I am not guilty; I acted in self-defense and reflex in the face of a police officer who was out of control. James Boswell had his head beat in; possibly due to this he had problems. My jurors had not heard about that. They did not know he had suffered a head injury from the beating by a crack dealer five months earlier; that he was filled with anger and wrote an angry letter to the Houston Chronicle. He expressed his frustration at the mayor, police chief and fire chief. He was mad at the world. Three and a half months before I worked on a deal with the DEA, the informant was let off. At the moment he left the courtroom, he became angry with me; Officer Boswell was upset about this. Officer Boswell and an angry woman were in the police car and they were talking in raised voices. In other words, Officer Boswell was angry at the time I walked up. Officer Boswell may have reacted to the...(Offender stopped speaking in mid-sentence.) 
April 12, 1986|Charles William Bass #662|I deserve this. Tell everyone I said goodbye.
April 06, 2016|Pablo Vasquez #999297|I just want to tell my family thank you, my mom and  dad and sister and Sabrina. I love you Mercedes. I am sorry to David&#x2019;s family.  This is only way that I can be forgiven. You got your justice right here.  That&#x2019;s it. My trust in Jesus.
 January 29, 2003|Richard Dinkins #999022  | Written  To the families of Ms. Thompson and Ms. Cutler. I am sorry for what happened and that it was because of me that they are gone.  If there were any way I could change things and bring them back I would. But I can&apos;t.  Because of what I caused to happen many people were affected and I am very sorry that I did.  I have made my peace with God and I pray that soon everyone will be able to have closure in their hearts and lives.  To my family and friends, I love you and some day we will all be together again.  
January 20, 2016|Richard Masterson #999414|Sending me to a better place.&#xA0; I am alright with  this, you have to live and die by the choices that we make.&#xA0; I have made  mine.&#xA0; I love you Renee, I am gonna carry your heart and always carry my  heart in your heart.&#xA0; I am ready.

July 20, 2011|Mark Stroman, TDCJ #999409|Even though I lay on this gurney, seconds away from my death, I am at total peace. May the Lord Jesus Christ be with me. I am at peace. Hate is going on in this world and it has to stop. Hate causes a lifetime of pain. Even though I lay here I am still at peace. I am still a proud American, Texas loud, Texas proud. God bless America, God bless everyone. Let&apos;s do this damn thing. Director Hazelwood, thank you very much. Thank you everyone. Spark, I love you, all of you. I love you Conna.

Tell everybody I said hi and that I love them and I will see them on the other side. Okay? And now I just pray that if there is anything against me that God takes it home. I don&apos;t want nobody to be mad at nobody. I don&apos;t want nobody to be bitter. Keep clean hearts and I will see y&apos;all on the other side. Okay? I love y&apos;all, stay sweet. I love ya.  
 March 1, 2000  | Odell Barnes, Jr.| I&apos;d like to send great love to all my family members, my supporters, my attorneys. They have all supported me throughout this. I thank you for proving my innocence, although it has not been acknowledged by the courts. May you continue in the struggle and may you change all that&apos;s being done here today and in the past. Life has not been that good to me, but I believe that now, after meeting so many people who support me in this, that all things will come to an end, and may this be fruit of better judgments for the future. That&apos;s all I have to say.  
August 7, 2012  |Marvin Wilson, #999098|Bohannon, Peg and Kim, I love ya&apos;ll. Son, get your life right with Christ, also your mother. Give mom a hug for me and tell her that I love her. Ya&apos;ll do understand that I came here a sinner and leaving a saint. Take me home Jesus, take me home Lord, take me home Lord. I ain&apos;t left yet, must be a miracle. I am a miracle. I see you, Rich. Don&apos;t cry son, don&apos;t cry baby. I love ya&apos;ll. I&apos;m ready. <br>

November 14, 2012  |Ramon Torres Hernandez, #999431 |Can you hear me? Did I ever tell you, you have dad&apos;s eyes? I&apos;ve noticed that in the last couple of days. I&apos;m sorry for putting you through all this. Tell everyone I love them. It was good seeing the kids. I love them all; tell mom, everybody. I am very sorry for all of the pain.

July 7, 2011|Humberto Leal, TDCJ #999162|I am sorry for everything that I have done. I&apos;ve hurt a lot of people. For years I have never thought that I deserved any type of forgiveness. Lord Jesus Christ in my life, I know He has forgiven me, I have accepted His forgiveness. I have accepted everything. Let this be final and be done. I take the full blame for this. I am sorry and forgive me. I am truly sorry. I ask for forgiveness. Life goes on and it surely does. I am sorry for the victim&apos;s family for what I had did. May they forgive me. I don&apos;t know if you believe me, life goes on. I am sure it does. To the man to the right of me, I ask for forgiveness for you. Life goes on, it surely does. I ask for forgiveness. I am truly sorry. That is all. Let&apos;s get this show on the road. One more thing, Viva Mexico, Viva Mexico.

 February 25, 2003|Richard Head Williams #999251| Spoken: The statement I would like to make is to all my loved ones - and to the Abrahams and Williams families.  We came a long way through the tragedy - from hate to love and I would like to apologize for the pain I have caused all my families on both sides.  I am looking at you Mr. Frank: I am sorry brother for what happened to your sister and I hope that you would forgive me one day.  Ask God to forgive me and ask God to forgive you and allow me to pass through.  My brother Farooq, I love you my brother and send my love to all my family members.  And I was not a monster like they said I was.  I made a mistake and this mistake cost - but they won&apos;t cost no more.  I leave you with all my love and blessings.  may Allah bless each and every one of you.

June 16, 2011|Lee Taylor, TDCJ #999344|Yes, sir. Jennifer, I love you. Mom, I love you. Rick, take care of you. For all of you people, I defended myself when I killed your family member. Prison is a bad place. There was eight against me. I didn&apos;t set out to kill him. I am sorry that I killed him, but he would not have been in prison if he was a saint. I hope ya&apos;ll understand that. I love you, baby.

March 14, 2017 |James Bigby #997 |Yes, I do, Grace Kehler is that you? I have given Warden  Jones a written statement that will explain a lot more. I hope this will bring  you closure and answers to some questions. I hope this will bring you peace and  I&apos;m sorry for all the pain and suffering. I&apos;m sorry it went on for a terribly  long time. I&apos;m sorry to you especially Grace Kehler. To the Kehler, Johnson and  Crain family, I pray that you won&apos;t hate Jesus, the letter will explain more.  I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m sorry. I hope that my death will bring you peace and closure. I  pray that maybe someday will bring you peace. I hope that you could forgive me,  but if you don&apos;t I understand. I don&apos;t think I could forgive anyone who would  of killed my children. I&apos;m sorry for your suffering you&apos;ve had for a long time.  I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m sorry. I love you Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus.

June 26, 2002|Jeffrey Williams #999154|The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the still waters, He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name&apos;s sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for Thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me, in the presence of mine enemies. He anointeth my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the House of the Lord forever. Amen. Amen.

June 18, 1997|Irineo Montoya #847|Goodbye.
May 7, 2013    |Carroll Parr, #999479   |First of all; Shonna talk to your brother. He&apos;ll tell you the truth about what happened to your husband. I told Bubba to tell you what happened. Now, my statement to the world:  I am in the midst of truth. I am good, I am straight, don&apos;t trip. To all my partners, tell them I said like Arnold Schwarzenegger, &quot;I&apos;ll be back.&quot; These eyes will close, but they will be opened again, my understanding of God is, Jesus has got me through. To my family, I love ya&apos;ll. 
 August 16, 2001  |Jeffery Doughtie #999106|For almost nine years I have thought about the death penalty, whether it is right or wrong and I don&apos;t have any answers. But I don&apos;t think the world will be a better or safer place without me. If you had wanted to punish me you would have killed me the day after, instead of killing me now. You are not hurting me now. I have had time to get ready, to tell my family goodbye, to get my life where it needed to be.  It started with a needle and it is ending with a needle.  Carl, you have been a good friend, man. I am going to look for you. You go back and tell your daughter I love her. Tell her I came in here like a man and I will leave like a man. It&apos;s been good, dude. Thank you, Shorty. I appreciate you. I came in like a man and I will leave like a man. I will be with you. I will be with you every time you take a shower. If you leave crying you don&apos;t do me justice. If you don&apos;t see peace in my eyes you don&apos;t see me. I will be the first one you see when you cross over.  They got these numbers that I called today. Calling my family.  That is it. Ready, Warden.  
 December 15, 1999|Felder, Sammie #550| Like to tell my friends that I love them. Appreciate them being here to support me. Alison, I love you.  
October 24, 2012  |Bobby Lee Hines, #999025 |To the victim&apos;s family, I am sure I know that I took somebody special from ya&apos;ll. I know it wasn&apos;t right, it was wrong. I wish I could give it back, but I know I can&apos;t. If giving my life in return makes it right, so be it. I ask that ya&apos;ll forgive me. I know God forgave me. I know He has forgiven me for what I did. I don&apos;t believe that taking my life will solve anything. I believe that if I was locked up for the rest of my life, that would be more of a punishment. To do this is setting me free. God bless ya&apos;ll. I wish there was something I could do.
April 2, 1997|David Herman #999003|It was horrible and inexcusable for me to take the life of your loved one and to hurt so many mentally and physically. I am here because I took a life and killing is wrong by an individual and by the state, and I am sorry we are here but if my death gives you peace and closure then this is all worthwhile. To all of my friends and family, I love you and I am going home -  
December 11, 1994|Raymond Kinnamon #808|&#x2026;guys like them got tied up in something like this. Thank Chaplain Taylor and Jane. I just got your letter. Thanks to Carolyn and Gloria, who have been my friends for over four years. I want to remember Patsy Buntion, Gladys and a lot more friends. I want to thank the prosecutor in my case; it took courage for him to do what he did but he did what he did because he believed in the judicial system.
October 28, 2014  |Paredes, Miguel Angel, #999400|To the victim&#x2019;s family, I want you to know that I hope  you let go of all of the hate because of all my actions.&#xA0; I came in as a  lion and I come as peaceful as a lamb.&#xA0; I&#x2019;m at peace.&#xA0; I hope society  sees who else they are hurting with this.&#xA0; To my loved ones, I hope both  victims find in their hearts to forgive me, and I have forgave everyone and I  love everyone, pray for my soul and I forgive myself.&#xA0; I love y&#x2019;all and  I&#x2019;ll be waiting for y&#x2019;all, my brother take care of my family.&#xA0; Take care  of my girl, my mom, my sons and all of my loved ones.&#xA0; Brother Wayne and  Brother Joe, thank y&#x2019;all.&#xA0; Jorge don&#x2019;t give up on Luis, I&#x2019;ll be  listening.&#xA0; Thank you for everything.&#xA0; Father I commend my soul,  please take care and watch everybody I leave behind.&#xA0; I am ready  Warden.&#xA0; Father please accept my soul.&#xA0; I am sorry, I love y&#x2019;all, I  am always going to be with you.&#xA0; I love y&#x2019;all, I love y&#x2019;all.

September 25, 2002  | Calvin King #999152| I want to say God forgives as I forgive. God is the greatest. Thank you.  
December 5, 2000|Garry Miller #947| Maggie, I am sorry. I always wanted to tell you but I just didn&apos;t know how. I have been praying for y&apos;all. I hope that y&apos;all find the peace that y&apos;all have been wanting. Lord, thank you for all my family, all my friends, and all my brothers on the row. Thank you for my spiritual family. Lord, be merciful with those who are actively involved with the taking of my life, forgive them as I am forgiving them. Be merciful to me a sinner. Protect us Lord as we stay awake and watch over us as we sleep as we wake may we may keep watch with Christ and sleep rest in His peace. All right, Warden. I am ready to go home.  
June 22, 2000| Gary Graham #696| I would like to say that I did not kill Bobby Lambert. That I&apos;m an innocent black man that is being murdered. This is a lynching that is happening in America tonight. There&apos;s overwhelming and compelling evidence of my defense that has never been heard in any court of America. What is happening here is an outrage for any civilized country to anybody anywhere to look at what&apos;s happening here is wrong.  I thank all of the people that have rallied to my cause. They&apos;ve been standing in support of me. Who have finished with me.  I say to Mr. Lambert&apos;s family, I did not kill Bobby Lambert. You are pursuing the execution of an innocent man.  I want to express my sincere thanks to all of ya&apos;ll. We must continue to move forward and do everything we can to outlaw legal lynching in America. We must continue to stay strong all around the world, and people must come together to stop the systematic killing of poor and innocent black people. We must continue to stand together in unity and to demand a moratorium on all executions. We must not let this murder/lynching be forgotten tonight, my brothers. We must take it to the nation. We must keep our faith. We must go forward. We recognize that many leaders have died. Malcom X, Martin Luther King, and others who stood up for what was right. They stood up for what was just. We must, you must brothers, that&apos;s why I have called you today. You must carry on that condition. What is here is just a lynching that is taking place. But they&apos;re going to keep on lynching us for the next 100 years, if you do not carry on that tradition, and that period of resistance. We will prevail. We may loose this battle, but we will win the war. This death, this lynching will be avenged. It will be avenged, it must be avenged. The people must avenge this murder. So my brothers, all of ya&apos;ll stay strong, continue to move forward.  Know that I love all of you. I love the people, I love all of you for your blessing, strength, for your courage, for your dignity, the way you have come here tonight, and the way you have protested and kept this nation together. Keep moving forward, my brothers. Slavery couldn&apos;t stop us. The lynching couldn&apos;t stop us in the south. This lynching will not stop us tonight. We will go forward. Our destiny in this country is freedom and liberation. We will gain our freedom and liberation by any means necessary. By any means necessary, we keep marching forward.  I love you, Mr. Jackson. Bianca, make sure that the state does not get my body. Make sure that we get my name as Shaka Sankofa. My name is not Gary Graham. Make sure that it is properly presented on my grave. Shaka Sankofa.  I died fighting for what I believe in. I died fighting for what was just and what was right. I did not kill Bobby Lambert, and the truth is going to come out. It will be brought out.  I want you to take this thing off into international court, Mr. Robert Mohammed and all ya&apos;ll. I want you, I want to get my family and take this down to international court and file a law suit. Get all the video tapes of all the beatings. They have beat me up in the back. They have beat me up at the unit over there. Get all the video tapes supporting that law suit. And make the public exposed to the genocide and this brutality world, and let the world see what is really happening here behind closed doors. Let the world see the barbarity and injustice of what is really happening here. You must get those video tapes. You must make it exposed, this injustice, to the world. You must continue to demand a moratorium on all executions. We must move forward Minister Robert Mohammed.  Ashanti Chimurenga, I love you for standing with me, my sister. You are a strong warrior queen. You will continue to be string in everything that you do. Believe in yourself, you must hold your head up, in the spirit of Winnie Mandela, in the spirit of Nelson Mandela. Ya&apos;ll must move forward. We will stop this lynching.  Reverend Al Sharpton, I love you, my brother.  Bianca Jagger, I love all of you. Ya&apos;ll make sure that we continue to stand together. Reverend Jesse Jackson and know that this murder, this lynching will not be forgotten. I love you, too, my brother. This is genocide in America. This is what happens to black men when they stand up and protest for what is right and just. We refuse to compromise, we refuse to surrender the dignity for what we know is right. But we will move on, we have been strong in the past. We will continue to be strong as a people. You can kill a revolutionary, but you cannot stop the revolution. The revolution will go on. The people will carry the revolution on. You are the people that must carry that revolutionary on, in order to liberate our children from this genocide and for what is happening here in America tonight. What has happened for the last 100 or so years in America. This is the part of the genocide, this is part of the African (unintelligible), that we as black people have endured in America. But we shall overcome, we will continue with this. We will continue, we will gain our freedom and liberation, by any means necessary. Stay strong. They cannot kill us. We will move forward.  To my sons, to my daughters, all of you. I love all of you. You have been wonderful. Keep your heads up. Keep moving forward. Keep united. Maintain the love and unity in the community.  And know that victory is assured. Victory for the people will be assured. We will gain our freedom and liberation in this country. We will gain it and we will do it by any means necessary. We will keep marching. March on black people. Keep your heads high. March on. All ya&apos;ll leaders. March on. Take your message to the people. Preach the moratorium for all executions. We&apos;re gonna stop, we are going to end the death penalty in this country. We are going to end it all across this world. Push forward people. And know that what ya&apos;ll are doing is right. What ya&apos;ll are doing is just. This is nothing more that pure and simple murder. This is what is happening tonight in America. Nothing more than state sanctioned murders, state sanctioned lynching, right here in America, and right here tonight. This is what is happening my brothers. Nothing less. They know I&apos;m innocent. They&apos;ve got the facts to prove it. They know I&apos;m innocent. But they cannot acknowledge my innocence, because to do so would be to publicly admit their guilt. This is something these racist people will never do. We must remember brothers, this is what we&apos;re faced with. You must take this endeavor forward. You must stay strong. You must continue to hold your heads up, and to be there. And I love you, too, my brother. All of you who are standing with me in solidarity. We will prevail. We will keep marching. Keep marching black people, black power. Keep marching black people, black power. Keep marching black people. Keep marching black people. They are killing me tonight. They are murdering me tonight.  
September 13 , 2011|Steven Woods, #999427|You&apos;re not about to witness an execution, you are about to witness a murder. I am strapped down for something Marcus Rhodes did. I never killed anybody, ever. I love you, Mom. I love you, Tali. This is wrong. This whole thing is wrong. I can&apos;t believe you are going to let Marcus Rhodes walk around free. Justice has let me down. Somebody completely screwed this up. I love you too, Mom. Well Warden, if you are going to murder someone, go ahead and do it. Pull the trigger. It&apos;s coming. I can feel it coming. Goodbye.
April 30, 2002| Rodolfo Hernandez #807  | Yes, sir.

 October 20, 2005|Luis Ramirez| Yes I do. I would like to address you first. I did not kill your loved one, but I hope that one day you find out who did. I wish I could tell you the reason why, or give some kind of solace; you lost someone you love very much. The same as my family and friends are going to lose in a few minutes. I am sure he died unjustly, just like I am. I did not murder him; I did not have anything to do with his death. And to you my family and friends, I love you dearly. Even though I die, that love for you will never die. Into Your hands, Lord, I commit my spirit. Thank you. Thank you all. 
November 10, 2004|Frederick Patrick McWilliams| Yes.  Well here we are again folks, in the catacombs of justice.  You know there is a lot I wanted to say - a lot I thought I&apos;d say - but there is not a whole lot to say.  There are people that will be mad thinking I try to seek freedom from this, but as long as I see - freedom belongs to me and I&apos;ll keep on keeping on.  The shackles and chains that just might hold my body can&apos;t hold my mind, but will kill me otherwise.  I love you momma, and Misty and Annette, Brenda and Anthony - and all my friends and everybody that supported me.  I leave my love here; I am never going to stop loving you.  My love is going to stay here.  
August 31, 1993|Richard J. Wilkerson #756|This execution is not justice. This execution is an act of revenge! If this is justice, then justice is blind. Take a borderline retarded young male who for the 1st time ever in his life committed a felony then contaminate his TRUE tell all confession add a judge who discriminates plus an ALL-WHITE JURY pile on an ineffective assistance of counsel and execute the option of rehabilitation persecute the witnesses and you have created a death sentence for a family lasting over 10 years.

I took a father, it wasn&apos;t my fault, it was an accident... God knows the truth. If my life could bring your father back, then let it be. Don&apos;t take my smile for Disrespect. If I see your father I will ask him forgiveness. I told the Judge the truth it was an accident. I&apos;ll smile and I am not sad. If my life could make you happy, be free.

February 11, 1999|Danny Lee Barber #673|Hello, Ms. Ingram, it is good to see you. I said I could talk but I don&#x2019;t think I am gonna be able to. I heard one of your nieces had some angry words.

I pray that you get over it and that&#x2019;s the only thing I can think to say. I&#x2019;m regretful for what I done, but I&#x2019;m a different person from that time. If you could get to know me over the years, you could have seen it. I&#x2019;ve got some people over here that believes that.

You broke the law.  The judges and courts helped you and you didn&apos;t have all the facts.  When you look at the video, you know you can&apos;t see anyone.

It was done out of fear, stupidity, and immaturity.  It wasn&apos;t until I got locked up and saw the newspaper.  I saw his face and his smile and I knew he was a good man.  I am sorry for all your family and my disrespect - he deserved better.  Sorry Gus.  I hope all the best for you and your daughters.  I hope you have happiness from here on out.

To the Sullivan and Hayden families, I do not come here with the intention to make myself out to be a person that I am not.  I never claimed to be the best person.

She was a friend of mine and I betrayed her trust.  I love you all.  Tell momma I love her. The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want,  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me beside the still waters.  He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of righeousness for his name&apos;s sake.  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me.  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.   Our Father, who are in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name.  Thy kingdom come.  Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven.  Give us this day our daily bread.  And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those who trespass against us.  And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil.  For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever.  Amen  All right Warden, let&apos;s give them what they want. 
August 28, 2002|Toronto Patterson #999178|I am sorry for the pain: sorry for what I caused my friends, family and loved ones.  I feel a great deal of responsibility and guilt for all this crime.  I should be punished for the crime, but I do not think I should die for a crime I did not commit.  I am sorry, but nothing can bring Kim, Ollie, and Gigi back.  But I pray my death brings peace for my family that may unite the family.  I ask for your forgiveness and that you will all forgive me.  I have no animosity;  I am at peace and invite you all to my funeral.  We are still family.  I love you all, Momma, Aunt Deidra, family and everybody.  I love you.  I am ready, Warden.

 November 13, 2008|Manns, Denard   | Yes. From Allah we came and to Allah we shall return. I would like to give thanks for the unjust way my trial attorneys John Donahue and Frank Hollbrook purposely denied me a fair trial. I would like to thank Walter E. Reeves for bringing up claims that did not exist. Most importantly, I would like to thank John Hurley, who was suppose to be off my case but was granted to be back on. For those who kept agreeing with me, keep it real. Ya&apos;ll will always stay real in my heart. Barbara, I love you, Al and Paul, I love you. Jess and Chong, I love you now and forever. I am ready for the transition.

 October 26, 2004|Dominique Green   | Yes.  Man, there is a lot of people there.  There was a lot of people that got me to this point, and I can&apos;t thank them all.  But thank you for your love and support; they have allowed me to do a lot more than I could have on my own.  Sheila, I wish I would have met you seven years ago; it would have been a lot easier.  But I have overcame a lot.  I am not angry, but I am disappointed that I was denied justice.  But I am happy that I was afforded you all as family and friends.  You all have been there for me; it&apos;s a miracle.  I love you.  And I have to tell Jessica I am sorry.  I never knew it would come to this.  Lorna, you know you have to keep my struggle going.  I know you just lost your baby; but you have to keep running.  Andy, I love you man.  Tell Andre and them that I didn&apos;t get a chance to reach my full potential, but you can help them reach theirs.  You needed me, but I just did not know how to be there for them.  There is so much I have to say, but I just can&apos;t say it all.  I love you all.  Please just keep the struggle going.  If you turn your back on me, you turn your back on them.  I love you all and I&apos;ll miss you all.  Thanks for allowing me to touch so many hearts.  I never knew I could do it, but you made it possible.  I am just sorry.  And I am not as strong as I thought I was going to be.  But I guess it only hurts for a little while.  You all are my family.  Please keep my memory alive.  
April 11, 2002|William Burns #692| I just want to tell my Mom that I am sorry that I caused her so much pain and my family and stuff.  I love them and I hurt for the the fact that they are going to be hurting.  I really hate that; and that I&apos;m hoping they are going to be O.K.  
 May 9, 2002| Reginald Reeves #999119| I pray that we all may learn to love and forgive so that we can have peace in the world.  It is with loving and forgiveness and living to learn to love and loving to live that we can learn the power of forgiveness and learn to live as brothers and sisters on this earth.  Until then, this will continue to happen -- capital punishment; and if we don&apos;t forgive, sooner or later we will all self-destruct.  You need to open up your heart and let God in.  I apologize for taking the life of your daughter and I know how much pain you must be in because I saw my family today.  And although my pain is not as deep as yours, I am very sorry.  Today, this does not bring you peace because this is not really the way.  We should forgive and love and I do apologize with all my heart and soul and I love you and I know your spirit and God dwells within us and we are all one big family of humanity; we must all learn to love and live together.  I will see you on the other side.  Thank you for your hospitality.

I mean ah, I don&apos;t want y&apos;all to look at me like I am a killer or something man, cause I ain&apos;t no killer. I mean, I didn&apos;t, I didn&apos;t kill your father. I mean, I know how it look, but I didn&apos;t do it. You know what I am saying? You were out there with me, Tommy. I mean, you know man. (mumbled) You know I always did want to say something to y&apos;all. Right? I can&apos;t say that I done it because I didn&apos;t do it. I&apos;ve got love for everybody. I am a Christian now. I&apos;m saying I want everybody to keep thier heads up and stay strong. I&apos;m going to stay strong. I&apos;ll be seeing you, this is my last breath. Ricky, keep your head up baby.

I mean, I know, ah, I mean, I&apos;m sorry anybody, ah, anybody got killed that night. It wasn&apos;t supposed to happen, but I didn&apos;t do it. I really didn&apos;t do it. I don&apos;t want y&apos;all to go through life thinking that I did. You know what I am saying? I love everybody and I want y&apos;all to stay strong. Right? It would take me an hour or a long time, man, but, ah, man, I don&apos;t want to hold y&apos;all up, man, like that, ah. Y&apos;all just keep your head up and stay strong, man.

 November 17, 2004| Anthony Guy Fuentes|Yes sir.  Sorry that I have to put my family through this.  All of you know I got my peace.  And I hope you find peace.  And to the family, the truth will come out and I hope you find peace.  I got my peace.  I hope everybody has their peace.  I am tired.  I am going to be in your heart.  I love you all.  To everybody else, the truth will be known.  It didn&apos;t come out in time to save my life.  It is wrong to put the families through this.  But when it comes out, I hope it stops this.  It is wrong for the prosecutors to lie and make witnesses say what they need them to say.  The truth has always been there.  I just hope everybody has their peace.  Today I get mine.  I love you all.  
January 26, 1999|Martin Sauceda Vega #932|I really don&#x2019;t have much to say. All I want to say is that when the state introduced my sister and my niece as state witnesses, it&#x2019;s not that they testified against me. The thing is, my lawyers would not subpoena anyone, so they allowed the state to subpoena them to paint a picture to the jury that my own sister and niece was testifying against me.

And to all my friends that have been out there, thank you for your friendship and support and all you have done for me.

Mistakes are made, but with God all things are possible. So put your faith and trust in Him.

Stay strong. Thank you.

June 14, 1994|Denton Crank #803|To my family who has kept me strong, I give my love.
 September 18, 2002|Ron Shamburger #999167| A lot of people have always asked if there is a Heaven, and I say there is.  There is a Heaven and a Hell.  They ask, &quot;Who goes to Heaven?&quot;  I believe that it is those who have placed their faith in Jesus Christ. Romans 3:25:  For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. Romans 6:23:  The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life. Romans 5:8:  While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 10:9:  If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus Christ, and that He was raised from the dead, thou shalt be saved. John 3:16:  For God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him shall have everlasting life. A lot of people forget about: John3:36:  If you have the Son, you have life and if you have not the Son, the wrath of God lies on you. In this life, we sin and we make mistakes: 1 John 1:19:  If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive our sins. I had a verse that jumped out at me a few days ago.  Psalm 99:8 speaks of the holiness of God and He was to the people a God who forgave, but He took vengeance on his deeds.  I am not here because of my faith in the Lord Jesus, but I am here for not other reason than my own actions.  To the Bakers, I am really sorry for the pain and sorrow I caused you.  I really do not know what to say, but I am sorry - forgive me.  And to my parents, I am sorry for the pain I have caused you.  Forgive me; thank you for your love. 
 May 19, 2009| Riley, Michael|Yes I do. To the Harris family. I have been trying to tell you for years that I am sorry. I know that I hurt your family bad. I am sorry.

Tim Jackson, Bobby Dan Spade and Mr. Segal thank you for your lies. Your lies set me free. I couldn&apos;t do a life sentence. To my mom, I&apos;m sorry. I love you. I&apos;m not the big son that you wanted me to be. But, I love you. To my friends, Synnova, Kay I thank you for everything. I&apos;m ready. I told you years ago that I was ready.

I know you believe that you&#x2019;re going to have closure tonight and as I stand before God today, the true judge, I had nothing to do with the death of your family. I ask God to hold this. I would like to address the family of John T. Ford: I ask for forgiveness, because I do stand guilty for my involvement for that. Thank you Lord Jesus Christ for coming to my life. (quiet singing) Thank you Lord Jesus for coming into my life, you walked me through prison. Thank you Lord Jesus because you died for me. Thank you Lord Jesus for remembering me...

One day, I hope you will. It is a tragedy for my family and your family. I am sorry. My special angel, I love you. And I love you, Connie. May God pass me over to the Kindom&apos;s shore softly and gently. I am ready.

Heavenly Father, as I come to you to praise and thank you that even now I can endure the pain that you endured when you died for me on the cross. You have forgiven me of my sins and travesties. Thank you, Lord, for giving me strength. Give them strength to forgive me. Ask them to have them forgive me in their hearts. I ask you to touch each and every one of them. I am truly repentant. In the name of Jesus Christ I love you. Warden I am ready to go home please. Remember God is peace, God is love. 
March 7, 2012  |Keith Thurmond, #999435|All I want to say is I&apos;m innocent, I didn&apos;t kill my wife. Jack Leary shot my wife then her dope dealer Guy Fernandez. Don&apos;t hold it against me, Bill. I swear to God I didn&apos;t kill her. Go ahead and finish it off. You can taste it. 
 October 12, 2004|Aldrich, Donald  |Yes sir, I would.  To the West Family, I would just like to apologize for your loss.  I hope that you can forgive me.

I love you, Mom -

 March 15, 2000| Timothy Gribble #000929  | Verbal Statement: Okay, thank you. To the Weis family, and ah I just want you to know from the bottom of my heart that I am truly sorry. I mean it, I&apos;m not just saying it. Through the years of being in prison I come to hear and respect our life. It was wrong what I did. I know you had to go through a lot of pain and I&apos;m sorry. To the Jones family, the same is true, I am truly truly sorry. I wanted to prepare a longer statement but time ran out. I had the chaplain write down a few words for my friends and for you, my family. I would like him to read them for me, and ah, just please find peace. 
 February 28, 2002|Monty Delk #900  | &quot;I&apos;ve got one thing to say, get your Warden off this gurney and shut up. I am from the island of Barbados. I am the Warden of this unit. People are seeing you do this.&quot;  
 March 7, 2001|Dennis Dowthitt #999047| I am so sorry for what y&apos;all had to go through. I am so sorry for what all of you had to go through. I can&apos;t imagine losing two children. If I was y&apos;all, I would have killed me. You know? I am really so sorry about it, I really am. I got to go sister, I love you. Y&apos;all take care and God bless you. Gracie was beautiful and Tiffany was beautiful. You had some lovely girls and I am sorry. I don&apos;t know what to say. All right, Warden, let&apos;s do it.  
August 10, 2005| Gary Sterling|I would like the Chaplain to say a prayer, not only for me but for the victim&apos;s family.  For them being misled, I am sorry.  That is all I have to say. 
October 22, 2001|Gerald Mitchell #838| Yes, sir. Where&apos;s Mr. Marino&apos;s mother? Did you get my letter? Just wanted to let you know, I sincerely meant everything I wrote. I am sorry for the pain. I am sorry for the life I took from you. I ask God for forgiveness and I ask you for the same. I know it maybe hard, but I&apos;m sorry for what I did. To my family I love each and every one of you. Be strong. Know my love is always with you...always. I know I am going home to be with the Lord. Shed tears of happiness for me. I love each and everyone of you. Keep on living.  Betty, you have been wonderful. You guided me to the Lord. You have been like a mother to me. Sean, Rusty, Jenny, Marsha, God Bless each and every one of y&apos;all. Jesus, I confess you as my Lord and Savior. I know when I die, I&apos;ll have life in heaven and life eternal everlasting. I am ready for that mansion that you promised me. Take care. It&apos;s alright Sean, it&apos;s alright. I&apos;m going to a better place.  
 January 14, 2009   |Curtis Moore   |Yes, Sir. I love you Irene and I want to thank you for all the beautiful years of friendship and ministry. I love you.  
December 7, 1998|Daniel Lee Corwin #969|I guess the first thing I want to do is thank some very special people, Sara and Sabrina. And for affording me the opportunity that ya&#x2019;ll did. It made a real big difference in my life. I thank you. Thank you again from the deepest part of my heart. I&#x2019;m sorry. The biggest thing I wanted to say was to you and family and I know I haven&#x2019;t had a chance to talk with ya&#x2019;ll in any form or fashion or way or manner. And I regret what happened and I want you to know that I&#x2019;m sorry. I just ask and hope that sometime down the line that you can forgive me. I think in a lot of ways that without that it becomes very empty and hollow and the only thing we have is hatred and anger. I guess the only thing I have to say about the Death Penalty is that a lot of times people think of it as one sided, but it&#x2019;s not. It&#x2019;s two sided. There pain on both sides and it&#x2019;s not an issue that people just sit there and voice off and say, well, this is a good thing, or this is a bad thing. But it&#x2019;s something that&#x2019;s, you know, needs to be looked at and desired in each heart. I just hope that all of you can understand that and someday forgive me. I want to thank ya&#x2019;ll for affording me the opportunity to talk and meet with ya&#x2019;ll. It meant so much. Thank you so much for being with me and my family. Thank you. I love you.
May 25, 2000| Clayton, James #921|I would like to take this time to, ah, to use this moment an example for Christ. I would like to follow his example and leave with peace in my heart and forgiveness. There is no anger in my heart about this entire situation. I just want to testify to all of y&apos;all that I have loved you. I appreciate your concern and genuine love for me. God bless you. I love all of all. Jesus is Lord.  
August 24, 2006  | Justin Fuller| Yes I do, I would like to tell my family thank you for your support, and my friends. And let everyone know that you must stay strong for each other. Take care of yourselves. That&apos;s it, Warden.  
April 19, 1998|Frank Basil McFarland #963|I owe no apologies for a crime I did not commit. Those who lied and fabricated evidence against me will have to answer for what they have done. I know in my heart what I did and I call upon the spirit of my ancestors and all of my people and I swear to them and now I am coming home.  
March 11, 2003|Bobby Cook #999094|I would like to say to the victim&apos;s family, if this goes on record, that I know they have gotten grief and I know with this execution, it will not be any relief to them. That with my death, it will just remind them of their loved one, Mr. Holder. I would like to say to them, &quot;please forgive me for what happened; it was self defense...and I was never able to get up on the stand to tell them.&quot; I know this is wrong. I am going home to the Lord.  
October 1, 2002|James Powell #999001|I am ready for the final blessing.

 August 22 , 2007|Conner, Johnny   | Could you please tell that lady right there, can I see her, she is not looking at me. I want you to understand something, hold no animosity towards me. I want you to understand please forgive me. When I get to the gates of Heaven I will open my arms for you. Please forgive me, do not worry about what is going to happen. I don&apos;t want you to worry. I don&apos;t want you to suffer, I am not mad at you. Shed no tears for me. Even though you don&apos;t know me, I love you, I love all of ya&apos;ll. I ask ya&apos;ll in your heart to forgive me. To my family, I love all of you. What&apos;s happening now, you are suffering. I didn&apos;t mean to hurt you. Stephanie, Felicia, Carlos and my Father. I love my Father. I want you to understand that life goes on. Continue to live your life and don&apos;t be angry at what is happening to me. This is destiny, this is life. This is something I have to do and I am going to be with my momma and your momma. I want everyone to continue to live your life. Thank you and I love all of you. What is happening to me now is unjust and the system is broken. At the same time I bear witness there is no God but Allah and the Prophet Mohammad. Unto Allah, I belong unto Allah I return. I love you.  
September 25, 2012  |Cleve Foster, #999470|Yes, you know I sat in my cell many days wondering what my last words would be: love for my family, grandson, friends. I love you very much. Tonight when I close my eyes, I&apos;ll be with my Father. Some time ago I got a letter, I read it, and stuck it in with a bunch of stuff; and I thought to myself, what a cold-hearted person. I was asked about the letter, I spent half the night looking for the letter. A little part of the letter touched me. Over the years I have learned to love. God is everything. God is my life. Tonight, I will be with Him. I am a parent myself.  I have so much for this dear lady. I understand where they&apos;re coming from, I thought every person was cruel. I love you so, Susan. You know what it is girl, love ya. Maurie, appreciate it girl. Much love to you all. Mrs. Cox, love you. Momma, you are my hero. I wish this world was just like you. Another mother got hurt, as a parent I understand the pain. That letter she wrote wasn&apos;t wrong, she was just hurting. She showed God&apos;s love for letting me know that love will be there to welcome me home. I love you all. I don&apos;t know what you are going to feel after tonight. I love you. I pray one day we will all meet in heaven. A man told me 11 years ago the hardest thing to say is, &quot;I forgive you.&quot; Hope one day we all be together again. I love you all: Susan, Mrs. Cox, momma, Maurie, Michael. Grandbabies make the world go around. I love you all. Warden, I am looking to leave this place on wings of a homesick angel. Ready to go home to meet my maker. What a friend we have in Jesus, oh my God, I lay in awe &apos;cause I love you God. I love you momma. I love you Susan. <br>

July 18, 2012  |Yokamon Hearn, #999292|Yes, I would like to tell my family that I love ya&apos;ll and I wish ya&apos;ll well. I&apos;m ready. <br>

March 11, 2015| Manuel Vasquez #999336|Yes sir, I want to say I love you to all my family and friends. Thank you Lord for your mercy and unconditional love. In Jesus name I pray, Amen.
 November 20, 2002|William Chappell #960|Jane, Grace and all of you all, I know you think I did this, and I&apos;m sure you think this is wonderful in you eyes.  But, let me tell you something, there were two DNA tests run and none matched me.  I wanted a third, but that never happened.  Three people at different times confessed to killing these people - your parents.  They did not know me.  My request is that you get yourselves in church and pray for forgiveness because you are murdering me.  I did not kill anyone in my life.  If you will look at your house and the police report, there are several bullet patterns shot into the West wall over the bed and the East wall and North wall and your sister was in the front bedroom while 30 shots were fired.  There&apos;s no way in hell she would have laid in that bed.  If you think I did this, you need to think again.  There were three people in the house and have confessed to it.  Larry Ashworth in Fort Worth killed seven people.  All I was asking for was a DNA and I could not get it.  But get in church and get right with God.  Jane, you know damn well I did not molest that kid of yours.  You are murdering me and I feel sorry for you.  Get in church and get saved.  I really don&apos;t know what else to tell you.  
January 31, 1995|Clifton Russell #658|I would like to thank my friends and family for sticking with me through all of this. I would like to encourage my brothers to continue to run the race. I thank my Father, God in Heaven, for the grace he has granted me &#x2013;  I am ready.
May 19, 2005|Richard Cartwright|Yes, I do.  I just want to thank all my friends and family who gave me support these past eight years.  I want to apologize to the victim&apos;s family for the pain I caused them.  And to everyone at the Polunsky Unit, just keep your heads up and stay strong.  
June 18, 2015|Gregory Russeau #999430|&#x201C;Yes, I would like to thank my family and friends for what  y&#x2019;all have done for me.&#xA0; Thank you for being here with me that I do not  have to transition alone.&#xA0; I have peace.&#xA0; To my daughter, I love you,  to my grandbabies, sisters and brothers, I love you.&#xA0; I am ready to go  home.&#x201D;
April 22, 2010   |William Josef Berkley   |Samantha, I love you with all my heart and soul. Cori, thanks for everything, make sure my princess is all right. Death before dishonor. Cori, I think you should continue with criminal law. It&#x2019;s your decision; they need lawyers out there that will fight. Death before dishonor. Warden let her rip. Thank you for coming Irene.  
July 30, 1993|Danny Ray Harris #649|I would like to tell my family I love them very dearly, and I know they love me. I love all of the people who supported me all of these years. I would like to tell the Merka family I love them, too. I plead with all the teenagers to stop the violence and to accept Jesus Christ and find victory. Today I have victory in Christ and I thank Jesus for taking my spirit into His precious hands. Thank you, Jesus.  
July 9, 1985|Henry Porter #551|I want to thank Father Walsh for his spiritual help. I want to thank Bob Ray (Sanders) and Steve Blow for their friendship. What I want people to know is that they call me a cold-blooded killer when I shot a man that shot me first. The only thing that convicted me was that I am a Mexican and that he was a police officer. People hollered for my life, and they are to have my life tonight. The people never hollered for the life of the policeman that killed a thirteen-year-old boy who was handcuffed in the back seat of a police car. The people never hollered for the life of a Houston police officer who beat up and drowned Jose Campo Torres and threw his body in the river. You call that equal justice. This is your equal justice. This is America&#x2019;s equal justice. A Mexican&#x2019;s life is worth nothing. When a policeman kills someone he gets a suspended sentence or probation. When a Mexican kills a police officer this is what you get. From there you call me a cold-blooded murderer. I didn&#x2019;t tie anyone to a stretcher. I didn&#x2019;t pump any poison into anybody&#x2019;s veins from behind a locked door. You call this justice. I call this and your society a bunch of cold-blooded murderers. I don&#x2019;t say this with any bitterness or anger. I just say this with truthfulness. I hope God forgives me for all my sins. I hope that God will be as merciful to society as he has been to me. I&#x2019;m ready, Warden.  
April 30, 2009| Johnson, Derrick     |Don&apos;t cry, it&apos;s my situation. I got it. Hold tight, It&apos;s going to shine on the golden child. Hold tight. I love you , I&apos;m through with my statement.  
January 31, 2002  | Randall Hafdahl #826|Spoken: Yes, I do.  My last full statement is being released in a way other than me right here.  All I want to say, I love you all.  Approximately 28 years ago, I remember looking down at a bassinet, I saw an angel.  I am looking at her right now.  I love you, Colleen.  Let&apos;s get going.  The road goes on forever, and the party never ends.  Let&apos;s rock and roll.  Let&apos;s go Warden.  Me and you, all of us.  Remember wet Willie - keep on smiling, keep on smiling.  I love you.  It&apos;s on the way, I can feel it.  It&apos;s OK, baby.  We have a party to go to.  I can feel it now.  
January 10, 2007|Carlos Granados|Yes, Love you mom, love you pop, love you Sara, and Amanda.  Um, Cathy you know I never meant to hurt you.  I gave you everything and that&apos;s what made me so angry.  But I didn&apos;t mean to hurt you.  I am sorry.  That&apos;s it.  
 June 20, 2007| Rodriguez, Lionell| First of all, you have every right to hate me and every right to want to see this. To you and to my family, you don&apos;t deserve to see this.  I wasn&apos;t going to apologize by letter, I wanted to apologize face to face.  None of this should have happened.  It is the right thing to do.  I have a good family, just like you are a good family.  I hope that any bitterness that you have because of what I did, I hope you can learn to forgive.  I asked my family to contact you, because they did no wrong.  I am responsible and I am sorry to you all.  Thank you all my Jefe (dad), my brothers, Maria and my Grandfather.  Thank you, we will see each other again.  Thank you, Lord Jesus receive my spirit. 
February 16, 2016|Gustavo Garcia #999018|To my family, to my mom, I love you. God bless you, stay strong. I&apos;m done.

November 8, 2012 |Mario Swain, #999475|This offender declined to make a last statement.  <br>

January 26, 2017|Edwards, Terry|Yes, I made peace with God. I hope y&apos;all make peace with this.
January 28, 2004|Billy Vickers #999087|Yes.  I would just like to say to my family that I am sorry for all the grief I have caused.  I love you all.  Tell Mama and the kids I love you; I love all of you.  And I would like to clear some things up if I could.  Tommy Perkins, the man that got a capital life sentence for murdering Kinslow -- he did not do it.  I did it.  He would not even have had anything to do with it if he had known I was going to shoot the man.  He would not have gone with me if he had known.  I was paid to shoot the man.  And Martin, the younger boy, did not know what it was about.  He thought it was just a robbery.  I am sorry for that.  It was nothing personal.  I was trying to make a living.  A boy on Eastham doing a life sentence for killing Jamie Kent - I did not do it, but I was with his daddy when it was done.  I was there with him and down through the years there were several more that I had done or had a part of.  And I am sorry and I am not sure how many - there must be a dozen or 14 I believe all total.  One I would like to clear up is Cullen Davis - where he was charged with shooting his wife.  And all of these it was never nothing personal.  It was just something I did to make a living.  I am sorry for all the grief I have caused.  I love you all.  That is all I have to say. 
August 12, 2015|Daniel Lopez  #999555|&#x201C;I would like to thank you.&#xA0; I hope this execution  helps my family and also the victim&#x2019;s family.&#xA0; This was never meant to be,  sure beyond my power. I can only walk the path before me and make the best of  it.&#xA0; I am sorry for putting y&#x2019;all through this.&#xA0; I am sorry, I love  you.&#xA0; I am ready.&#xA0; May we all go to Heaven.&#xA0; Thank you Warden Jones.&#x201D;
August 7, 2002  | Richard Kutzner #999227| Well, yes, sir.  Rebecca, I understand that you wanted this day to come, you got what you wanted.  I didn&apos;t kill your mother.  The two guys that worked for me killed your mother and they are still out there.  If Mr. McDougal had allowed the DNA evidence, I would be exonerated.  Mr. Tolson, I understand you are out there.  If there is any justice in this world, please use this to keep other people from being where I&apos;m at.  Warden, this is murder just as surely as the people that killed Rebecca&apos;s mother.  Send me home.  
 March 4, 2009|Morris, Kenneth Wayne   | Yes, I have to say that I am sorry for all the pain that I have caused you and your family. I only have love in my heart. I hope that you can all forgive me. I pray that you can all forgive me. Thank you for standing by me and being there for me. I am ready to go home. My baby I will always be with you. I really am sorry.  
May 15, 2013|Jeffrey D. Williams, #999350|You clown police. You gonna stop with all that killing all these kids. You&apos;re gonna stop killing innocent kids, murdering young kids. When I kill one or pop one, ya&apos;ll want to kill me. God has a plan for everything. You hear? I love everyone that loves me. I ain&apos;t got no love for anyone that don&apos;t love me.
 July 12, 2000| Joiner, Orien Cecil #902| Kathy, y&apos;all take and I bless all of you and I am glad I have had y&apos;all in my life. As I have said from the very first thing, I am innocent of this crime and God knows I am innocent and the four people that was murdered know I am innocent and when I get to heaven I&apos;ll be hunting you and we&apos;ll talk. I feel sorry for the families that&apos;s had to suffer and my family and I have &apos;em all in my prayers. I love you all. Y&apos;all take and y&apos;all look after Sheila and Shannon and them, call &apos;em and get the pictures to &apos;em and everything and, ah, again, like I said, I feel sorry for the families, but if it takes my death to make them happy, then I will bless them. I have no hard feelings toward anyone cause the Lord feels that it is my time to come home to Him, my work on earth is done and that, ah, like I said, I am just sorry for, but they will have to go through this one time again, cause sooner or later, whoever did this crime is going to be caught and they&apos;ll have to come down here and do this again and they will realize they witnessed an innocent man going to be with Jesus Christ.  
April 9, 2015|Kent W. Sprouse  #999471|&#x201C;I would like to apologize to the Moreno family and the Steinfeldt family for all of the trouble I have caused them.

June 29, 1993|Markum Duff-Smith #694|I am the sinner of all sinners.  I was responsible for the &#x2019;75 and &#x2019;79 cases. My trial was not just; it was not fair; they lied against me. I love all of those on Death Row, and I will always hold them in my hands. Those who stood by me, I will always love you. Jim and Judy Peterson and Chaplain Lopez, I thank you for staying by my side.
 February 8, 2006| Robert Neville Jr.| Yes.  Ms. Carolyn Barker, and Tina, I would like to apologize to you all.  To Amy&apos;s sister, and everybody else here.  I love you all.  I hope you can find it in yourselves to forgive me and I hope all this here will kinda settle your pain and I hope the Lord will give you comfort and peace.  And I just want you to know I am very sorry for what I have done.  And if I see Amy on the other side, I will tell her how much you love and miss her and we will have a lot to talk about.  Mom, Dad, and Charlotte - I am sorry for putting you through all this pain and stuff.  I did talk to Brandon and I think I got a little stuff stopped.  I love you all and I will see you on the other side.  O.K.

  I just want to make a statement to all my friends, family, and supporters. Thank you all for the love. To the Christian hip-hop community, all the positive brothers I&apos;ve done time with. To all the people that took the time to write a letter. Thank you.<br>
    To my family, we are one. To my beautiful daughter, the best thing that ever happened to me. I love you endlessly. I am you and you are me forever.<br>
      Lastly to God himself....Thank you being a gracious friend to me.  I love you with all my heart, mind, strength, in Jesus name.
 November 16, 2005  |Shannon Charles Thomas  |Yes.  Man, I just want you to know how much I love them.  I want you to be strong and get through this time.  Do not fall back.  Keep going forward.  Don&apos;t let this hinder you.  Let everybody know I love them (several names listed), Kevin - as well as everyone else in the family.  Tell them that I love them and stay strong.  This is kind of hard to put words together; I am nervous and it is hard to put my thoughts together.  Sometimes you don&apos;t know what to say; I hope these words give you comfort.  I don&apos;t know what to say.  I want you to know I love you; just stay strong and don&apos;t give up.  Let everybody know I love them...and love is unconditional, as Mama has always told us.  I may be gone in the flesh, but I am always with you in spirit.  I love you. 
 September 5 , 2007  |Tony Roach  |Yes sir, I do. Go ahead? First of all I want to thank God for the love; thank God for the love from the family and friends that I have. To God I give the glory though the years. I love and care about the Lord. The Lord knows that I prayed for the victim&apos;s family. I know you all probably have bitterness and hate for what I did. There is not a day goes by that I have not prayed for Ronni Dawn Hewitt and Carol Dawson and her daughter who was left behind. I pray to God, the Lord Almighty that like he did for me, he will reach out and help you. I just pray that the Lord takes away your bitterness. There is so much hurt that I have caused you all. On the phone, I talked to my family for two hours. It was hard to see such a big man just break down and cry like a little baby. I hope this will touch your hearts like you have touched mine. I know it is hard for you all. I am to blame for this, I will take that Lord, when I get there. Back in 2003, I want to tell you this. I got down on my knees. The Lord knew my heart. I wanted to kill myself. I spoke to Ms. Ronnie Dawn Hewitt. The next day I received a letter that they had lost a friend to suicide. She said that she forgave me and that was something that I needed to hear. God helped me to forgive myself and move on. I just pray that some day you will find forgiveness in your heart. Know that your loved one is in a good place. I am sorry for what I have done. I cannot agree with this injustice. The Bible says that you shalt not kill, but it also says to obey the government. I am sorry, forgive me. Francis, I love you and thank you for being here. I have no ill will towards anyone carrying out this so called justice. Thank you. I am ready Warden. 
 September 22, 2009|Coleman, Christopher   |Yes, Ain&apos;t no way fo&apos; fo&apos;, I Love all yall.  
November 18, 2009   |Simpson, Danielle   | Yeah, I want to tell my family I love ya&apos;ll. Tell Kate I love her too. Tell brother, my kids I live ya&apos;ll. I&apos;m gonna miss ya&apos;ll. I&apos;m ready, ready. 
 May 3, 2005  | Lonnie Pursley| Yes. I would like to address the victim&apos;s family. I received your poem and I am very grateful for your forgiveness. I still want to ask for it anyway. I have Jesus in my heart and I am sorry for any pain I caused you all. Thank you for your forgiveness. I am sorry. Ashlee, Pam -- I am going to miss you all. I love you all. Give everybody my love. Give everybody my love, O.K.? Mother, James, Justin, Corey, Brent, grand-babies and Daddy - I love you Pam. I love you Ashlee, Pammy and Irene. I will see you all on the other side. Couple friends on death row who have helped me; Shy Town and Crazy Jay...I love you all and for all your support. Uncle Ray too. I am saved and I am going home, O.K.? You all stay strong. You all stay strong. That is all.  
 August 8, 2002| T.J. Jones #999133  | I would like to say to the family, I regret the pain I&apos;ve put you through and I hope you can get over it someday.  Mom and Dad, I love you.  Take care.  I&apos;m ready.  
 March 10, 2009   |Martinez, James Edward|Yes sir, I want to tell my mom that I love her and thank her for everything that she has done for me. Tell my sister that I love her too thank her for everything that she has done for me. I hope you can move on after this. I&apos;ll be fine. I&apos;ll be O.K. I love you too. I love you too. Take care O.K. That&apos;s all I have to say Warden. Thank you sir.  
 October 30, 2008|Gregory Wright #999253|Yes I do. There has been a lot of confusion on who done this. I know you all want closure. Donna had her Christianity in tact when she died. She never went to a drug house. John Adams lied. He went to the police and told them a story. He made deals and sold stuff to keep from going to prison. I left the house, and I left him there. My only act or involvement was not telling on him. John Adams is the one that killed Donna Vick. I took a polygraph and passed. John Adams never volunteered to take one. I have done everything in my power. Donna Vick helped me; she took me off the street. I was a truck driver; my CDL was still active. Donna gave me everything I could ask for. I helped her around the yard. I helped her around the house. She asked if there were anyone else to help. I am a Christian myself, so I told her about John Adam. We picked him up at a dope house. I did not know he was a career criminal. When we got to the house he was jonesin for drugs. He has to go to Dallas. I was in the bathroom when he attacked. I am deaf in one ear and I thought the T.V. was up too loud. I ran in to the bedroom. By the time I came in, when I tried to help her, with first aid, it was too late. The veins were cut on her throat. He stabbed her in her heart, and that&apos;s what killed her. I told John Adams, &quot;turn yourself in or hit the high road.&quot; I owed him a favor because he pulled someone off my back. I was in a fight downtown. Two or three days later he turned on me. I have done everything to prove my innocence. Before you is an innocent man. I love my famly. I&apos;ll be waiting on ya&apos;ll. I&apos;m finished talking.

I never meant to cause ya&apos;ll so much pain. Not one day has passed that I wish I could take it back. After today, I hope you can go on. I hope this brings you closure. God knows I didn&apos;t want to do what I did. I loved your daughter. I hope to God, He lets me see her in Heaven so I can apologize to her. I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m glad ya&apos;ll came. Joey, I am really sorry, Joe.

 August 8, 2001| Mack Hill #961|First, I would like to tell my family that I love them. I will be waiting on them. I am fine. I hope that everyone gets some closure from this. I am innocent. Lubbock County officials believe I am guilty. I am not. Travis Ware has the burden on him to prove that he did not commit felonies. He needs to be stopped or he is going to do it time and time again.

 April 22, 2003|John Chavez #999186|To the media, I would like for you to tell all the victims and their loved ones that I am truly, truly sorry for taking their loved ones&apos; lives.  And I hope they will find it in their heart to forgive me for what I did to them.  I am a different person now, but that does not change the fact of the bad things I have committed.  God can give you the same peace He gave me and you can be in His hands.  And to my beautiful family, be strong.  Remember what I said, &quot;God is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.&quot;  OK, Warden.  
June 20, 2006|Lamont Reese| Yeah.  Momma, I just want you to know I love you.  I want all of you to know I love you all.  I am at peace; we know what it is.  We know the truth.  Stay out of crime; there is no point in it.  I am at peace.  We know the truth and I know it.  I have some peace.  I am glad it didn&apos;t take that long - no 10 or 20 years.  I am at peace.  And I want everyone to know I did not walk to this because this is straight up murder.  I just want everybody to know I didn&apos;t walk to this.  The reason is because it&apos;s murder.  I am not going to play a part in my own murder.  No one should have to do that.  I love you all.  I do not know all of your names.  And I don&apos;t know how you feel about me.  And whether you believe it or not, I did not kill them.  I just want you all to have peace; you know what I&apos;m saying.  There is no point in that.  It is neither here nor there.  You have to move past it.  It is time to move on.  You know what I&apos;m saying.  I want each one of my loved ones to move on.  I am glad it didn&apos;t last long.  I am glad it didn&apos;t last long.  I am at peace.  I am at peace to the fullest.  The people that did this - they know.  I am not here to point fingers.  God will let them know.  If this is what it takes, just do what you got to do to get past it.  What it takes.  I am ready, Warden.  Love you all.  Let my son know I love him. 
 March 29, 2007|Pippin, Roy  | Yes sir,  I charge the people of the jury.  Trial Judge, the Prosecutor that cheated to get this conviction.  I charge each and every one of you with the murder of an innocent man.  All the way to the CCA, Federal Court, 5th Circuit and Supreme Court.  You will answer to your Maker when God has found out that you executed an innocent man.  May God have mercy on you. My love to my son, my daughter, Nancy, Kathy, Randy, and my future grandchildren.  I ask for forgiveness for all of the poison that I brought into the US, the country I love.  Please forgive me for my sins.  If my murder makes it easier for everyone else let the forgiveness please be a part of the healing.  Go ahead Warden, murder me.  Jesus take me home.  
November 1, 2006| Donell Jackson  | To my family, first and foremost - I love you all. The calmness that I was telling you about, I still have it. You are Mario&apos;s Uncle, correct? I just wanted you to know that I wronged your family. I received nothing, I was not paid. I took his life for the love of a friend. I love you all. I just want you to know that. I know he does, I feel it. I&apos;m alright. Make sure momma knows, alright. Jermaine, I love you too man. Alright Warden.

 July 26, 2000| Juan Soria #837| I wish we could pray to Allah, the father of the universe. I ask for your protection and my salvation, my night and my day. I want you to lead me and I will follow. We give praise to Allah the divine and holy prophet. We know that you are Allah, that you are the prophet in these days that is in charge of the human race in this new era of time. These two (unintelligible) to the masters of the temple of the son we have been honored to dwell in our father&apos;s house at least for the time in which this finite time has come to it&apos;s assigned time for one. There is nothing strange, love governs all events, what is (unintelligible), who is who was his mother and father, we extend my love to all my brothers and sister extend to life and my religion, it is Allah. It is going in salvation of the nation I come from South, Central, and North America. (Unintelligible) that would save us. So, I call on to all of my brothers and sisters and to members of the human race that still have some knowledge for what love divine love is. That comes learned from your ancient forefathers. Love is brought by this prophet Allah. We extend our love to everyone who believes the faith of Islamic and chooses to love along with all their being. We come to understand what is finite and what is infinite. Again, I say it is an honor to live in my father&apos;s house. To see this divine great paradise that which I have come to see with the eye of the spirit, the spirit which was revealed by my prophet which was (unintelligible). We extend our love to everybody. Extend my love to my divine sister. Sister Dorothy, and my brother Tomas and we know that our father Allah will bless them in the following days to come.

 May 28, 2002| Napoleon Beazley #999141| The act I committed to put me here was not just heinous, it was senseless.  But the person that committed that act is no longer here - I am.  I&apos;m not going to struggle physically against any restraints.  I&apos;m not going to shout, use profanity or make idle threats.  Understand though that I&apos;m not only upset, but I&apos;m saddened by what is happening here tonight.  I&apos;m not only saddened, but disappointed that a system that is supposed to protect and uphold what is just and right can be so much like me when I made the same shameful mistake. If someone tried to dispose of everyone here for participating in this killing, I&apos;d scream a resounding, &quot;No.&quot;  I&apos;d tell them to give them all the gift that they would not give me...and that&apos;s to give them all a second chance. I&apos;m sorry that I am here.  I&apos;m sorry that you&apos;re all here.  I&apos;m sorry that John Luttig died.  And I&apos;m sorry that it was something in me that caused all of this to happen to begin with.   Tonight we tell the world that there are no second chances in the eyes of justice...Tonight, we tell our children that in some instances, in some cases, killing is right. This conflict hurts us all, there are no SIDES.  The people who support this proceeding think this is justice.  The people that think that I should live think that is justice.  As difficult as it may seem, this is a clash of ideals, with both parties committed to what they feel is right.  But who&apos;s wrong if in the end we&apos;re all victims? In my heart, I have to believe that there is a peaceful compromise to our ideals.  I don&apos;t mind if there are none for me, as long as there are for those who are yet to come.  There are a lot of men like me on death row - good men - who fell to the same misguided emotions, but may not have recovered as I have.  Give those men a chance to do what&apos;s right.  Give them a chance to undo their wrongs.  A lot of them want to fix the mess they started, but don&apos;t know how.  The problem is not in that people aren&apos;t willing to help them find out, but in the system telling them it won&apos;t matter anyway.  No one wins tonight.  No one gets closure.  No one walks away victorious.  
 July 10 , 2008| Turner, Carlton Akee #999321|First of all I would like to tell my Uncle Kyle that I am sorry. I have been sorry for the last 10 years for what I did. I wish you could accept my apology. I know you can&apos;t accept my apology, I know you can&apos;t give your forgiveness; it&apos;s okay and I understand. I have done what I could to heal the rest of the family. I wish that someday you could come to terms and understand. I know I was wrong; I accept responsibility as a man. I take this penalty as a man. This doesn&apos;t solve anything, &apos;cause it hurts others that love me. I am sorry. I love you Kjersti. I love you too Roland. I love you too Uncle Kyle; I am still your nephew, no matter what you believe. 
September 24, 2002| Rex Mays #999172  | I would like to say a final prayer: Dear Heavenly Father, I come to you today, Lord, and thank You for this opportunity to be with You in paradise.  I ask You for forgiveness for the ones that need to be forgiven.  Dear Lord, deliver us from evil and give us the comfort and peace and joy that we need.  Dear Lord, I ask You right now to be with each of the witnesses and lift them up and be on solid ground.  Let them know what has gone on and may we all see each other again.  Amen. I would like to thank each witness:  Ms. Cox, Whiteside, Reed, Scott, and Chad.  I am going to go and see Jesus tonight and reserve a special place for each one of you.  You all have been there when no one else was.  Thank you for all of your love and support.  Just know that I am ready to go.  You all know what I&apos;ve gone through.  I am going to a better place with the Lord.  I&apos;m mad for one reason, that I&apos;m leaving you behind, when I am going to a better place.  Y&apos;all still have to go through this hell on earth.  Just remember the good things and not the bad.  You are all loved and respected. Warden, just give me parole and let me go home to be with the Lord.

I don&apos;t think you know the true reason for doing what I did, but Brandy and I had a suicide pact and I just didn&apos;t follow through with it.  That did not come out in the trial.  I am not trying to hurt you by telling you this.  I am trying to tell you the truth.  I want Cindy to know that I know she is out there -- and Vicente Hernandez that I love them.  Thank you for all you have done and I want to make sure you are alright.  That is all I want to say.  I am ready.  See you later.  I am ready.

 April 3, 2001|Jason Eric Massey #999121  | Yes, first I would like to speak to the victims&apos; family.  First of all, I would like to say that I do not know any of y&apos;all and that is unfortunate, because I would like to apologize to each and every one of you individually.  I can&apos;t imagine what I have taken from y&apos;all, but I do want to apologize and I want to let you know that I did do it.  You guys know that I am guilty and I am sorry for what I have done.  I apologize and I know that you may not be able to forgive me and I know that may not be able to forgive me in this life and in this world, but I hope sometime in the future you will be able to find it in you to forgive me.  And I want you to know that Christina, she did not suffer as much as you think she did.  I promise you that.  I give you my word.  I know you guys want to know where the rest of her remains are.  I put her remains in the Trinity River.  I have said that since I have come to death row.  I want to apologize to you again.  I hope sometime in the future you can forgive me.  Okay, now I want to speak to my mom and my family.  Brother Anderson, Kathy, I want you to know that I appreciate all these years that you have been coming to see me on death row and Daddy, I love you.  I appreciate y&apos;all being here and being strong for me, and Mama, you know I love you, and I appreciate all of these visits, the letters and everything y&apos;all have done for me.  Y&apos;all have been wonderful.  You too, Granny.  I love y&apos;all and you know, I want to apologize to y&apos;all too for what I have done.  For all of the pain that I have caused, but all of this pain has brought us closer together and all of this suffering that we have been through has brought us all closer to the Lord and in the end that is what counts.  Isn&apos;t it?  That&apos;s what counts in the end; where you stand with Almighty God.  I know that God has used this to change my life.  And it&apos;s all been worth it because of that.  If I lie here today where I lie, I can say in the face of death, Jesus is Lord.  He has changed my life and I know that when I leave this body, I am going home to be with the Lord forever.  That is all I want to say.  I love y&apos;all and I won&apos;t say goodbye, I will say I will see you again.  I love you, Daddy. Tonight I dance on the streets of gold.  Let those without sin cast the first stone.

You don&apos;t need any more killing.  You don&apos;t need any minimum, maximum security, death row.  You don&apos;t need the death penalty.  We need more loving fathers and mothers.  It is a good day to die.  Take me God, Hold me in yours and carry me home.

If you look at the transcripts, I didn&apos;t kill Mr. Newman and I didn&apos;t rob your house. There are two people still alive. I was just there. When I saw you in the truck driving away, I could have killed you but I didn&apos;t. I&apos;m not a killer. My momma was abused. I&apos;m sorry for what you&apos;ve gone through. It wasn&apos;t me that harmed and stole all of your stuff. If you look at the transcripts you will see. I ask the good Lord to forgive me.

December 15, 1993|Clifford Phillips #723|I want to express my feelings regarding the mishap of the deceased Mrs. Iris Siff. That was a very unfortunate incident and only God knows why it was an unintentional situation that took place. I want to express my remorse to the family and the discomfort and pain I caused in their lives. Only God will determine if I am truly guilty or innocent of being the type of person I have been drawn up to be by the press and media. I have given my wife the power and energy to be a disciple of Islam. I rescued her from a wretched life in Ireland. I thank Allah for sending her to me. Certainly murder cannot be an instrument of Allah. My wife is very devoted.
May 15, 1986|Jay Kelly Pinkerton #686|&quot;Be strong for me,&quot; Pinkerton told his father, Gene Pinkerton, as witnesses entered the execution chamber. &quot;I want you to know I&#x2019;m at peace with myself and with my God,&quot; Pinkerton said.

October 30, 1984| Thomas Barefoot #621| When asked if he had a last statement, he replied, &quot;Yes, I do.&quot;I hope that one day we can look back on the evil that we&#x2019;re doing right now like the witches we burned at the stake. I want everybody to know that I hold nothing against them. I forgive them all. I hope everybody I&#x2019;ve done anything to will forgive me. I&#x2019;ve been praying all day for Carl Levin&#x2019;s wife to drive the bitterness from her heart because that bitterness that&#x2019;s in her heart will send her to Hell just as surely as any other sin. I&#x2019;m sorry for everything I&#x2019;ve ever done to anybody. I hope they&#x2019;ll forgive me. &quot;Sharon, tell all my friends goodbye.

To the ones representing me today, thank you for everything. The system has failed me. This is a miscarriage of justice. There are people on death row that need help. I love my family. I love you too, Mom. I am alright. I asked the Lord to have mercy on me and I hope He has mercy on these people carrying out this mass slaughter. They have no respect for humanity.  To Melanie, I never meant to hurt you. You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. I am not asking for your forgiveness. All I have to worry about is God forgiving me. I hope you get better and for the doctors to continue to take care of you. Take care of my mother for me. To everybody, know that I love you and I am OK. Lord, have mercy on my soul. Lord, have mercy on my soul. Lord, have mercy on these peoples&apos; soul. Life is not supposed to end this way. No more pain and frustration. When I knock at the gates, they will open up and let me in. To my mom and everybody, I love you. I can feel it right now. My life, my life.
January 27, 2016|James Freeman  #999539|None.
 August 31, 2006|Derrick Frazier  | Yes I do.  Debbie, my Baby, I love you; do you know I love you.  You are my life.  You are my wife - always stay strong.  Stay strong everybody.  I am innocent.  I am being punished for a crime I did not commit.  I have professed my innocence for nine years, and I continue to say I am innocent.  Let my people know I love them.  We must continue on.  Do not give up the fight; do not give up hope for a better future.  Because we can make it happen.  I love you, I love my son, and I love my daughter.  Bruno, Chuckie, Juanita, Ray - I love you, all of you.  Stay strong baby.  I love you forever.  
December 9, 1999|Beathard, James #785| I want to start out by acknowledging the love that I&apos;ve had in my family. No man in this world has had a better family than me. I had the best parents in the world. I had the best brothers and sisters in the world. I&apos;ve had the most wonderful life any man could have ever had. I&apos;ve never been more proud of anybody than I have of my daughter and my son. I&apos;ve got no complaints and no regrets about that. I love everyone of them and have always been loved all of my life. I&apos;ve never had any doubts about that. Couple of matters that I want to talk about since this is one of the few times people will listen to what I have to say. The Unites States has gotten to a now where they zero respect for human life. My death is just a symptom of a bigger illness. At some point the government has got to wake up and stop doing things to destroy other countries and killing innocent children. The ongoing embargo and sanctions against places like Iran and Iraq, Cuba and other places. They are not doing anything to change the world, but they are harming innocent children. That&apos;s got to stop at some point. Perhaps more important in a lot of ways is what we are doing to the environment is even more devastating because as long as we keep going the direction we&apos;re going the end result is it won&apos;t matter how we treat other people because everybody on the planet will be on their way out. We have got to wake up and stop doing that. Ah, one of the few ways in the world the truth is ever going to get out, or people are ever going to know what&apos;s happening as long as we support a free press out there. I see the press struggling to stay existent as a free institution One of the few truly free institutions is the press in Texas. People like the Texas Observer and I want to thank them for the job they&apos;ve done in keeping me and everybody else informed. I hope people out there will support them, listen to them and be there for them. Without it, things like this are going to happen and nobody will even know. I love all of you. I always have I always will. I would like to address the State of Texas and specially Joe Price, the District Attorney who put me here. I want to remind Mr. Price of the mistake he made at Gene Hawthorn&apos;s trial when he said that Gene Hawthorn was telling the truth at my trial. Mr. Price is a one-eyed hunting dog. He in fact is not a one-eyed hunting dog, and in fact Gene Hawthorn lied at my trial. Everybody knew it. I&apos;m dying tonight based on testimony, that all parties, me, the man who gave the testimony, the prosecutor he used knew it was a lie. I am hoping somebody will call him to the floor for recent comments he&apos;s made in the newspaper. It&apos;s bad enough that a prosecutor can take truth and spin on it and try to re-doctor it. But when they actually make facts up and present to the public as trial&apos;s evidence. That goes beyond fail, that&apos;s completely unforgivable and I hope somebody makes Mr. Price account for or explain the tennis shoes he is talking about that put me here. I&apos;m still completely lost on that and I&apos;m hoping that somebody will go back and verify the trial record and make him accountable for lying to the public and the press that way. That&apos;s really all I have to say except that I love my family. and nobody, nobody has got a better family than me. I love you booger bear. I love doodle bug, too. Don&apos;t let them ever forget me. I&apos;ll never forget them. I&apos;ll see you on the other side, okay. Bye bye Debbie. Bye bro, bye booger bear. Father Mike, Father Walsh, love you all. That&apos;s all, sir.  
March 13, 1985|Stephen Peter Morin #712|Heavenly Father, I give thanks for this time, for the time that we have been together, the fellowship in your world, the Christian family presented to me (He called the names of the personal witnesses.). Allow your holy spirit to flow as I know your love as been showered upon me. Forgive them for they know not what they do, as I know that you have forgiven me, as I have forgiven them. Lord Jesus, I commit my soul to you, I praise you, and I thank you.
 January, 20, 2000| David Hicks #930  | Hey, how y&apos;all doing out there? I done lost my voice. Y&apos;all be strong now, alright? Don, thanks man. I love you, Gloria, always baby. That&apos;s all I got to say. Hey, don&apos;t y&apos;all worry about me, okay?  
November 12, 2013    |Jamie McCoskey, #999053 |The best time in my life is during this period. If I had to do again, I would not change a thing. I have been touched by an angel&apos;s wings. If I had it to do again, I would change Dwyer&apos;s parents suffering, because I know they are. I know that is not going to eliminate the pain, because I have a child. God, I want to say something so bad. I appreciate the people that helped me out. I appreciate the people that helped me out, and uh, know that I love you, Angel and your family and all the people that helped me out. And if this takes the pain away, so be it. I love you. I&apos;m ready to go.

September 4, 1999| William Prince Davis #614  | I would like to give thanks to God Almighty, by whose grace I am saved through His son, Jesus Christ, without whom I would be nothing today. Because of this mercy and grace, I have come a long way, and I would like to thank God and others who have been instrumental. I would like to say to the Lang family how truly sorry I am in my soul and in my heart of hearts for the pain and misery that I have caused from my actions. I am truly sorry. And to my family I would also like to extend to them the same apology for the pain and misery that I have put them through, and I love them dearly from the bottom of my heart, and one day I would like to see them on the other side. Some I will; some I won&#x2019;t. I would like to thank all of the men on Death Row who have showed me love throughout the years, but especially the last two or three weeks, and I hold nothing against no man. I am so thankful that I have lived as long as I have. I hope that I have helped someone. I hope that [by] donating my body to science that some parts of it can be used to help someone, and I just thank the Lord for all that he has done for me. That is all I have to say, Warden.  Oh, I would like to say in closing, &quot;What about those cowboys?&quot;  
 March 6, 2007  |Robert Perez| Yes sir, Ernest, Christopher, Ochente, Mary and Jennifer tell all the kids I love them and never forget.  Tell Bobby, Mr. Bear will be dancing for them.

July 11, 2006| Derrick O&apos;Brien| I do.  I am sorry.  I have always been sorry.  It is the worst mistake that I ever made in my whole life.

 November 1, 2000| Jeffery Dillingham #999071| I would just like to apologize to the victim&apos;s family for what I did. I take full responsibility for that poor woman&apos;s death, for the pain and suffering inflicted on Mr. Koslow.  Father, I want to thank you for all of the beautiful people you put in my life.

I thank you for all the things you have done in my life, for the ways that you have opened my eyes, softened my heart. The ways that you have taught me.

02/12/2009  |Johnson, Johnny| The Polunsky dungeon should be compared with the Death Row Community as existing not living. Why do I say this, the Death Row is full of isolated hearts and suppressed minds. We are filled with love looking for affection and a way to understand. I am a Death Row resident of the Polunsky dungeon. Why does my heart ache. We want pleasure love and satisfaction. It. The walls of darkness crushed in on me. Life without meaning is life without purpose. But the solace within the Polunsky dungeon, the unforgivesness within society, the church Pastors and Christians. It is terrifying. Does anyone care or who I am. Can you feel me people. The Polunsky dungeon is what I call the pit of hopelessness. The terrfying thing is the US is the only place, country that is the only civilized country that is free that says it will stop murder and enable justice. I ask each of you to lift up your voices to demand an end to the Death Penalty. If we live, we live to the Lord. If we die we die to the Lord. Christ rose again, in Jesus name. Bye Aunt Helen, Luise, Joanna and to all the rest of yall. You may proceed Warden. (began singing)  
July 7, 1999|Tyrone Leroy Fuller #934|Yes, to my family, I love you. Please do not mourn my death or my life. Continue to live as I want you to live. I hold no bitterness toward no one. Just remember the light. I&#x2019;m gonna let this light shine. Let it shine. Let the light shine.

September 23, 1998|David Castillo #770|Keep it brief here. Just want to say, uh, family, take care of yourselves. Uh, look at this as a learning experience. Everything happens for a reason. We all know what really happened, but there are some things you just can&#x2019;t fight. Little people always seem to get squashed. It happens. Even so, just got to take the good with the bad. There is no man that is free from all evil, nor any man that is so evil to be worth nothing. But it&#x2019;s all part of life, and my family, take care of yourselves. Tell my wife I love her. I&#x2019;ll keep an eye on everybody, especially my nieces and nephews. I&#x2019;m pretty good. I love ya&#x2019;ll. Take care. I&#x2019;m ready.

Heavenly Father, I confess my sins, really I do. Let me know that I will be in Heaven tonight. Please let me know. I don&apos;t want to be in Hell with Satan or anyone else. Please, that is something I need to know. I ask that Jesus give me help.  In Jesus precious name, I pray this. I ask that you give me those promises, that you assure me that those promises are real.

 March 8, 2005|George Hopper| I want to apologize to you, and I am sorry.  I have made a lot of mistakes in my life.  The things I did changed so many lives.  I can&apos;t take it back, it was an atrocity.  I am sorry.  I beg your forgiveness, I know I am not worthy of it.  I love you Mom and Dad, and all my family.  Thank you for everything.  Jesus, thank you for your love and saving grace.  Thank you for shedding your blood on Calvary for me.  Thank you Jesus for the love you have shown me.  
October 28, 1997|Kenneth Ransom #772|First and foremost I would like to tell the victims&#x2019; families that I am sorry because I don&#x2019;t feel like I am guilty. I am sorry for the pain all of them have gone through during holidays and birthdays. They are without their loved ones.
November 5, 2009   |Oliver, Khristian   |Collins family, I know your not going to get the closure you are looking for tonight. I wish you the best. I prayed for ya&apos;ll every day and every night. I have only the warmest wishes. I am sorry for what you are having to go through. Mom, Pa, Kristy, Khristopher, Tony I love all ya&apos;ll. Thank you Mr. Whiteside. The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul; He guides me down the right paths. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup over runneth. 
June 11, 1997|Earl Behringer #914|It&#x2019;s a good day to die. I walked in here like a man and I am leaving here like a man. I had a good life. I have known the love of a good woman, my wife.

February 21, 2013   |Carl Blue, #999151 |Hey mom and pop. I love ya&apos;ll, all of you people in there. You know, ya&apos;ll have to come together, you too Terrella. Ya&apos;ll work on that. We all have to stand before God at the end of the day. Don&apos;t ever think you&apos;re perfect, none of us are perfect. God is the only one that is perfect. Jesus is perfect. I did wrong, now I am paying the ultimate price, even though it&apos;s a crooked way. I don&apos;t hate ya&apos;ll. Don&apos;t judge, I&apos;m not judging. God has to judge those people. I forgive. Always remember, Romans 12:19 is for real, hell is for real. If ya&apos;ll don&apos;t have your life right, get it right. We all have to die to get to heaven. Get your life right with Christ; it&apos;s coming to an end. I&apos;m talking to each and every soul in this building, in this room. I don&apos;t hate nobody, you&apos;re doing what you think is your job. God&apos;s law is above this law.
 June 11, 2008|Chamberlain, Karl #999241| I want you all to know, everyone with all my heart, soul, mind and strength. Thank you for being here today to honor Falicia Prechtl, whom I didn&apos;t even know. To celebrate my death. My death began on August 2, 1991 and continued when I began to see the beautiful and innocent life that I had taken. I am so terribly sorry. I wish I could die more than once to tell you how sorry I am. I have said in interviews, if you want to hurt me and choke me, that&apos;s how terrible I felt before this crime. I am sorry, it is her innocence and her life which began the remorse every since December 1, 1991. I have embraced life. Thank you for being a part of my life. I love you. May God be with us all. May God have mercy on us all. I am ready. Please do not hate anybody because.......(end of statement)  
January 28, 2003|Alva Curry #999080| I pray with the help of God that you will forgive me for the pain I caused your family. I am truly sorry. I wish I could take it back, but I just pray and ask that you forgive me.  
 January 24, 2000| Billy Hughes #556| Yes, I do. I want to tell you all how much I love you all, how much I appreciate everything. I love you all and my family. I treasure every moment that I have had. I want the guys to know out there not to give up, not to give in, that I hope someday the madness in the system, something will come about, something will be resolved.  I would gladly trade the last 24 years if it would bring back Mark Fredericks. Give him back his life, give back my father his life, and my mother her health. All I ask is that I have one day and all the memories of you and my family and all the things that have happened. They are executing an innocent man because things did not happen as they say they happen and there&apos;s. The truth will come out someday. I am not the same person as I was 24 years ago. Who would have thought it would have taken 24 years to get to this moment? Don&apos;t give up, don&apos;t give in. If I am paying my debt to society, I am due a rebate and a refund, but I love you all and you all watch out for Mom and you all keep up, keep going.  Thank you, Warden.  
December 14, 1999|Atworth, Robert #999199|Well, first, My people, you guys have heard everything I needed to say today. I hope I said the right things. I hope you heard me. And I hope you go beyond here and do what you need to do, do the right thing. Strength in numbers. Look out for each other. You still got a chance with Shawn. Edwin you know what you gotta do. You have my love. It&apos;s the right thing. And for everybody else, those people who have malice in their heart, allow ambitions to over ride what they know. Be right. Even though they just gotta do their job. For all of you with hatred in their veins, and think this is ashamed. You&apos;ve done nothing. I did this, I chose this, you&apos;ve done nothing. Remember this, if all you know is hatred, if all you know is blood love, you&apos;ll never be satisfied. For everybody out there that is like that and knows nothing but negative, kiss my proud white Irish ass. I&apos;m ready Warden, send me home.  
January 5, 1999|John Glenn Moody #933|I&#x2019;d like to apologize and ask forgiveness for any pain and suffering I have inflicted upon all of you, including my family. All of you, I am very sorry. There is a point where a man wants to die in judgment. Though my judgment is merciful, I hope and pray that all those involved as well as the judgment upon ya&#x2019;ll, will one day be more merciful than mine. God bless you all. God speed. I love you. Remain strong. Ask God to have mercy. I love you all, too. I&#x2019;m very sorry. I&#x2019;ve got to go now. I love you.  
July 31, 2013    |Douglas Feldman, #999326 |I hereby declare, Robert Steven Everett and Nicholas Velasquez, guilty of crimes against me, Douglas Alan Feldman. Either by fact or by proxy, I find them both guilty. I hereby sentence both of them to death, which I carried out in August 1998. As of that time, the State of Texas has been holding me illegally in confinement and by force for 15 years. I hereby protest my pending execution and demand immediate relief.
June 15, 2000|Paul Nuncio #999158| Verbal: I have a written statement for the press. It will be released as soon as they can. And I also responded to a comment to me from Sandy, daughter of Ms. Farris. I have felt deeply sorry for the deceased. But I&apos;m sorry that I wasn&apos;t the one that did it or anything. She will tell you that when she gets a chance to. When the time comes. I just wish just to be patient when the time for each and everyone of ya&apos;ll individually have ya&apos;ll time. But I&apos;m not putting pressure on either one of ya&apos;ll being having any guilt. I just want to say two thing, executing someone that is innocent, cause even though I am. The burden will be wiped away and you will be at ease to know that I know how it is and they will pay for it when their time comes. And all I have to say is that right now I&apos;m sorry that it happened and I was part, not part in it but, part responsible for not properly getting the word out in time to get the right victim or the right convict or the right person that did it. I just wish to say a little prayer for the family for their appearance and forgiveness in this matter. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give this day your daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Our Lord, Amen. And ah, don&apos;t be surprised if your Mom be the helper of God that would grab my hand and say &quot;You are now into eternal life with God.&quot; This is her being one of the chosen ones to give as proof of innocence. That&apos;s what I meant by telling you I don&apos;t mean to injure you anymore. When your time comes that she would let you know, if I was innocent or guilty. That about all I have to say. Love you all. 
January 21, 2009|Frank Moore| I would like to say that Capital self defense is not Capital Murder. I would like to make a statement to my wife and family, thank you for your support. I love you Roxanne, Kaye. Thank you Saint Gabriel&apos;s Church. Sylvia I appreciate you and thank you. All right Warden. (After the official last statement ended, he said I love you Mom.)  
July 29, 1997|Robert West #731|I would like to apologize for all of the pain and suffering I put you all through. I hope this will give you closure now and later on down the line.
June 12, 2000|Thomas Mason #999035| I understand that Michael Skains is supposed to be here somewhere. They did everything but make sure I got a fair trial to prove I was innocent. I wasn&apos;t the one who had the gun to give to police and all these altered records from the District Attorney&apos;s office and the Attorney General&apos;s office, that&apos;s why Michael Sputnick got fired and ran off when I filed these appeals. Not one of my sell out lawyers would use this evidence, because they all work as a conspiracy with the court. No doubt about it. Jack King did everything he could to keep me from making arms and showing this evidence. They wait till the hearing was over and then make the arguments in the court or on paper where nobody can rebut it or contradict the testimony or arguments. There&apos;s more than 30 altered and falsified records saying I told so and so this or that, but you go look in their record, it does not say Thomas Mason called them at all and told them anything. But that&apos;s okay. All this evidence is being saved, so Jack King can laugh all he wants like he&apos;s the big hero, after this is over with, that&apos;s fine. But the person that had the gun, they know was not Thomas Mason, so who&apos;s getting the last laugh after all? The guy that got away. But Jack King knows he illegally convicted me of all these falsified altered records. My sister&apos;s got the document that my lawyer filed, but he didn&apos;t file with the court. It&apos;s got the signature on it. He put this all in one record. So it&apos;s going to be saved. It ain&apos;t going to be destroyed just because I&apos;m dead. Everybody&apos;s got to go sooner or later and sooner or later everyone of ya&apos;ll will be along behind me. That&apos;s all I got to say.  
November 15, 2001| Emerson Rudd #936| Ok. I guess I&apos;ll address the Morgan family. Mrs. Morgan, the sister from the trial. Thirteen or fourteen years ago, I had a non-caring attitude at the time. I&apos;m sorry for shooting your son down at that particular robbery. Politicians say that this brings closure. But my death doesn&apos;t bring your son back - it doesn&apos;t bring closure. I wish that I could do more, but I can&apos;t. I hope this brings you peace. Ursula, Manon, and Irene, I love y&apos;all - take it easy. They&apos;ve gotta do this thing. I&apos;m still warm from the pepper gas. I love you. I&apos;m ready to go. Call my mom and tell her that this particular process is over. Tell all the brothers to keep their heads up, eyes toward the sky. 
 April 20, 2005|Douglas Roberts|Yes sir, Warden Okay I&apos;ve been hanging around this popsicle stand way too long.  Before I leave, I want to tell you all.  When I die, bury me deep, lay two speakers at my feet, put some headphones on my head and rock and roll me when I&apos;m dead.  I&apos;ll see you in Heaven someday.  That&apos;s all Warden. 
 December 8, 1999| David Long #862| Ah, just ah sorry ya&apos;ll. I think of tried everything I could to get in touch with ya&apos;ll to express how sorry I am. I, I never was right after that incident happened. I sent a letter to somebody, you know a letter outlining what I feel about everything. But anyway I just wanted, right after that apologize to you. I&apos;m real sorry for it. I was raised by the California Youth Authority, I can&apos;t really pin point where it started, what happened but really believe that&apos;s just the bottom line, what happened to me was in California. I was in their reformatory schools and penitentiary, but ah they create monsters in there. That&apos;s it, I have nothing else to say. Thanks for coming Jack.  
February 10, 2009|Scheanette, Dale Devon|Is the mic on? My only statement is that no cases have ever tried have been error free. Those are my words. No cases are error free. You may proceed Warden. 
 January 28, 2009|Martinez, Virgil Euristi| Yes I do. Um Abel, Love ya&apos;ll, Evelyn love ya&apos;ll, Armando and Delia I love ya&apos;ll. Do what I told you and you will see me one day. Do that and promise me. First, Veronica&apos;s sister. I know what you&apos;ve been told and that&apos;s all a lie. John Gomez killed your kids and sister. I know ya&apos;ll love John Gomez but he was a violent man. I wish I would have shot him in the leg, then he would be here. Those investigators were just trying to convict somebody. My gun had a hair trigger. Veronica told me to come and get my herb book and she went to the back of the closet. Her kids had asthma and I lent her the book. She said she would give it to me next time. She didn&apos;t want to break up, we still talked. She told me to come over. John Gomez said Veronica does not have the money for your book so don&apos;t come over. Me being a hot shot I went over there and I had my gun. I had children and nephews where I lived so I had to keep my gun in my truck for self defense. Veronica invited me in her house, the kids were still awake fixing to go to bed. I put the gun under my shirt and said Hi to Josh and Cassandra. John Gomez was there he told Veronica that &quot;he doesn&apos;t love you&quot; I didn&apos;t care.  
 May 9, 2000| William Kitchens #840|Yes, sir. James Webb, I don&apos;t know which one you are out there. I can&apos;t remember from the trial. I personally just want to let you know if there has ever been any doubt in your mind at all of what happened, I want you to know that Patty was always faithful to you, that I forced her for everything that she did and I am sorry. I just don&apos;t know how to tell ya&apos;ll I am sorry for what I did. There is no way for expressing I am sorry. I just hope that in some kind of way that ya&apos;ll can move on and find peace in your life. The Lord has given me peace and that is all that I pray for is that ya&apos;ll can find that peace. I just want you to know that I am sorry for what I done. I can&apos;t change that, all I can do is say I am sorry, that&apos;s nothing for what I have done. I can&apos;t replace your loss. I am sorry. I just want you to know that I love all of ya&apos;ll. It&apos;s been a pleasure, ya&apos;ll just keep on with life, it&apos;s gonna be good. The Lord&apos;s gonna be with us. If it&apos;s alright, I just want to say a prayer first. Father, God, I just thank you for the time that you have given me on this earth, for having mercy on somebody like me for all the despicable thing&apos;s I&apos;ve done in my life, Father, but you still with your love and your mercy reach down into my heart and changed it before it&apos;s too late. I ask that you bestow peace upon the family of Patricia Webb, that you let them know, Father, that you are in a place where they can obtain that peace, and you will help them move on in their life, Father. Help them, Father, to find it in their hearts, not for my sake , but for yours, and their sake to, Father, find it in their heart to forgive me for what I have done. Father, I just ask that you be with my family and comfort them to move on Father. Father, we are all here today for the mistake that I have made and I thank you for your mercy for sending your Son into this life, that we might come to know you, Father. Father, I pray for these Wardens and the officers and the people that deal with all of this, Father, I ask that you touch their hearts, Father, and if there is any wrong to it, that you will forgive them, Father. Just let them know that you love them, Father, and that You are the way. I just thank you and in Jesus&apos; name, I pray, Amen. I love ya&apos;ll, ya&apos;ll take care. I am so sorry.  
April 10, 2002|Jose Santellan, Sr.|First of all, I would like to apologize to the Guajardo family even though they are not present. I loved Yolanda a lot.

 May 11, 2000| Michael McBride #903| Written: The following is the personal final statement of and by Michael L. McBride. The Beatitudes: Jesus lifted up his eyes on His disciples, and said, &quot;Blessed be the poor: for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh. Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil for the Son of Man&apos;s sake. Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for behold, your reward is great in Heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets. But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation. Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall moan and weep. Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets. The supremacy of love over gifts: I Corinthians, Chapter 13: 4-8: Love is patient, love is kind, and is not jealous, love does not brag and is no arrogant, does not act unbecoming; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away; if there tongues, they will cease. Now abide faith, hope, love, these three: but the greatest of these is love. Poem: Do not stand at my grave and weep, I am not there I do not sleep. I am the diamond glints in the snow, I am the sunlight on the ripened grain. I am the gentle autumn rain. When you awaken in the morning&apos;s hush, I am the swift uplifting rush of quiet birds in circled flight, I am the soft stars that shine at night.  Do not stand at my grave and cry, I am not there. I did not die. Signed Michael L. McBride #903 May 11, 2000 Huntsville, Texas 
December 7, 1982|Charlie Brooks, Jr. #592|Statement to the Media: I, at this very moment, have absolutely no fear of what may happen to this body.  My fear is for Allah, God only, who has at this moment the only power to determine if I should live or die... As a devout Muslim, I am taught and believe that this material life is only for the express purpose of preparing oneself for the real life that is to come... Since becoming Muslim, I have tried to live as Allah wanted me to live.
June 26, 2013    |Kimberly McCarthy, #999287 |I just wanted to say thanks to all who have supported me over the years: Reverend Campbell, for my spiritual guidance; Aaron, the father of Darrian, my son; and Maurie, my attorney. Thank you everybody. This is not a loss, this is a win. You know where I am going. I am going home to be with Jesus. Keep the faith. I love ya&apos;ll. Thank you, Chaplain. 
May 17, 2006| Jermaine Herron| Yes sir.  To Mr. Jerry Nutt, I just hope this brings some kind of peace to your family.  I wish I could bring them back, but I can&apos;t.  I hope my death brings peace; don&apos;t hang on to the hate.  Momma, stay strong.  Lord forgive me for my sins because here I come.  Let&apos;s go, Warden.  
February 17, 2004|Cameron Todd Willingham #999041|Yeah. The only statement I want to make is that I am an innocent man - convicted of a crime I did not commit. I have been persecuted for 12 years for something I did not do. From God&apos;s dust I came and to dust I will return - so the earth shall become my throne. I gotta go, road dog. I love you Gabby. [Remaining portion of statement omitted due to profanity.] 
July 23, 2003|Cedric Ransom #999050| I just want to address Katrina and Rebecca. You have been beautiful to me. Without you in my life, I would not have been able to make it like this. Probably, I would have put up a good fight; you have calmed me. I love you. I respect you. Big brother, you put up the best fight you could and I love you. That is it. 
 July 20, 2006| Anderson, Robert| Yes, I would like to make a short brief one please.  To Audrey&apos;s grandmother, I am sorry for the pain I have caused you for the last 15 years and your family.  I have regretted this for a long time.  I am sorry.  I only ask that you remember the Lord because He remembers us and He forgives us if we ask Him.  I am sorry.  And to my family, and my loved ones - I am sorry for the pain for all those years and for putting you through all the things we had to go through.  I ask the Lord to bless you all.  Tammy, Irene, Betty, Dan Judy - I love you all.  And Jack, thank you.  Warden...  
 May 15, 2003| Bruce Jacobs #876  | Can you hear me, Chris?  The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.  He makes me to lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside the still waters.  He restores my soul;  He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His name&apos;s sake.  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for Thou art with me;  Thy rod and Thy staff comfort me.  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies;  Thou anointest my head with oil;  My cup runneth over.  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life;  And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. I want to thank you for being there with me all these years and supporting me and keeping me in the Word.  Michael, you take care of her and thank you Father Don and Chris.  And I want to thank the media for being nice to me all this time.  Bye, Chris.  I will see you.  Take care of yourselves and you all stay strong.  You keep doing your ministry.  
July 27, 2017 |Taichin Preyor |First and foremost I&apos;d like to say, &quot;Justice has never advanced by taking a life&quot; by Coretta Scott King. Lastly, to my wife and to my kids, I love y&apos;all forever and always. That&apos;s it.

April 16, 2014  |Jose Villegas, #999417|(Written statement) <br>
  I always said that if I even get to this point, I would have already said everything that needed to be said to all of those who I love and have been with me throughout this whole journey. Today, I realized that I can never say everything that needed to be said, because there is still so much that needs to be said. First of all, I love you. My children, my friends, and all my brothers who have shared this experience with me on the row and who continue to experience this without me, keep your heads up. I love all of you. Secondly, I am ok. I have peace in my heart and ready for the next journey. I&apos;m really ok. Last but not least, to my true brother in life, Crazy J, I love you, man. You and Bella have been the best. I&apos;m sorry I couldn&apos;t talk with you before all of this, but you know me...You are my bro. I love you. I&apos;m ok. My babies, remember what I said. We&apos;ll be together soon. I love all of you. John 14:27. 
November 09, 2005|Charles Daniel Thacker  |Jack and Irene, I love you guys.  Tell my family I love them.  I am sorry for the things I have done.  I know God will forgive me.  Keep track of Danielle for me.  I will miss you guys.  I love you.  I guess that&apos;s all. 
June 6, 2006  | Timothy Titsworth  | Yes, your honor.  I know you people are here to find closure for the things that you have done or that I have done.  There are no words to describe the pain and suffering that you have gone through all these years, that is something that I cannot take back from you all.  I hope that Megan, if she is here present today, know that today I hope you get peace and joy.  I am sorry that it has taken 14 years to get closure.  If it would have brought closure or brought her back, I would have done this years ago, I promise, I promise. My family all knows the sincerity in my heart when I say these words to you.  I didn&apos;t mean to inflict the pain and suffering on your family.  I pray that she is safe in Heaven.  I pray that you find closure and strength.  My family prays for you and everybody, if these words can ever touch your heart, I am sorry, I am truly sorry.  Ya&apos;ll take care.  I love ya&apos;ll.  Pastor tell Megan I am sorry. 
May 16, 1997|Clifton E. Belyeu #841|First of all I want to thank the LORD, my family and my wife Nora for all the support and encouragement they&#x2019;ve shown me through all this. I love you!! Now I want to thank all of you that came here today to be with me. I know most of you are here to see me suffer and die but you&#x2019;re in for a big disappointment because today is a day of joy. Today is the day I&#x2019;ll be set free from all this pain and suffering. Today I&#x2019;m going home to HEAVEN to live for all eternity with my HEAVENLY FATHER JESUS CHRIST, and as I lay here taking my last breath, I&#x2019;ll be praying for all of you because you&#x2019;re here today with anger and hatred in your hearts letting Satan deceive you into believing that what you&#x2019;re doing is right and just. GOD help you, because what you&#x2019;re doing here today and what&#x2019;s in your hearts here today makes you no better than any man or woman on death-rows across this country. Today you&#x2019;re committing murder too!!! I pray on my own behalf for forgiveness for any and all of the pain I&#x2019;ve caused you, I pray that some day you&#x2019;ll realize your own mistakes and ask GOD to forgive you as I have, because there is no peace without GOD&#x2019;s forgiveness. 
October 21, 2010|Wooten, Larry|No sir. Warden, Since I don&apos;t have nothing to say, you can go ahead and send me to my Heavenly Father.
 March 11, 2009   | Salazar, Luis Cervantes   | Yes, I do. Thank you for your friendship Reverend Whiteside and thank you for your fellowship. God help me to say this statement correctly. I would like to say goodbye to mom and my brother, brother, sister, Chelsea, Danny, Johnny, Tito and Sylvia. My heart goes is going ba bump ba bump ba bump. I love my children, Roxanne, Roseanne, Melissa, and Louis. I miss them; I will take them with me in my heart. I will keep them in my heart. Thank you Mrs. Dyson for praying for me and everyone that has been praying for me. God loves everybody and myself. I can&apos;t say this correctly. Let&apos;s see. That&apos;s all right. I guess that&apos;s it. Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed by thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen. Lord Jesus forgive of my sins, please forgive me for the sins that I can remember. 
January 18, 2000| Spencer Goodman #999031  | To my family, I love them. To Kami, I love you and will always be with you. That&apos;s it Warden.  
February 15, 2011 |Michael Wayne Hall, TDCJ #999346 |First of all I would like to give my sincere   apology to Amy&apos;s family. We caused a lot of heartache, grief, pain and   suffering, and I am sorry. I know it won&apos;t bring her back. I would like   to sing, I would like to sing for that person&apos;s dead. The old is gone. I   am not the same person that I used to be, that person is dead. It&apos;s up   to you if you would find it in your heart to forgive.
August 15, 1995|Vernon Sattiewhite #857|I would like to say &#x2013; I just hope Ms. Fielder is happy now. I would like to thank my lawyer, Nancy, for her help on my case and for being with me now.
February 16, 1995|Billy C. Gardner #751|I forgive all of you &#x2013; hope God forgives all of you too.
July 18, 1990|Mikel James Derrick #701|I just ask everybody I ever hurt or done anything wrong to, to just forgive me for whatever wrongs I done to them.
June 26, 2007  |Knight, Patrick  | Yes, I do.  I thank the Lord for giving me my friends, for getting me the ones I love.  Lord reach down and help innocent men on death row.  Lee Taylor needs help, Bobby Hines, Steve Woods.  Not all of us are innocent, but those are.  Cleve Foster needs help.  Melyssa, I love you girl.  I know I wasn&apos;t going to say anything, but I&apos;ve got to.  Jack, Irene, Danny, Doreen, I love you guys.  I said I was going to tell a joke.  Death has set me free.  That&apos;s the biggest joke, I deserve this.  And the other joke is I am not Patrick Bryan Knight, and ya&apos;ll can&apos;t stop this execution now.  Go ahead, I&apos;m finished.  Come on, tell me Lord.  I love you Melyssa, take care of that little monster for me.  
 May 4, 2000| Tommy Ray Jackson #821| Yes sir, I would like to address the Robinson family. There is nothing I can say here or anything I could probably do. Now you are all probably mad at me and I would probably be in the same situation you all in if anybody I thought killed anybody in my family ahh. If I knew who killed Rosalyn I would let you know, but, I am going to say this: I am going to heaven with God as my witness. Ros was a personal friend of mine. She was a beautiful person, very educated, her. I&apos;m very tight with the Robinson family. She was proud that she had a father that was a doctor. My family is not here present and that is by my wish and my wish only. Now the tables is turned. You are all here, the Robinson family is her to see me executed. That is something that I would not want for my family. In no form or fashion would I have ever want to see Rosalyn dead. I left the scene of where the incident happened. I guarantee you if I would have been there you would not be standing where you are if I would have been there. You all have some very serious look on your face and something very serious fixin&apos; to happen now. I will say this on my own behalf but then again I know it is not going to make any difference but what you fixing to witness is not a nice thing. It&apos;s not nice. It&apos;s not nice. The media. I would just like to address to the media with everybody&apos;s permission. I would like to say before I go that it has been said that I have shown no remorse, but if you look at my record and my background, ask anybody that know me that in order for me to show any kind of remorse for killing that ever been done, this one time I can&apos;t show no remorse for something that I did not do and if I did I would be faking. I would totally be faking and believe me there is nothing fake about me. Nothing fake. I&apos;ve done wrong, sure, I&apos;ve paid the time. This is one time that I know I cannot show no remorse for something that I did not do. I am at peace, please believe me. Wherefore, I figure that what I am dying for now is what I have done in my past. This is what I am dying for. Not for killing Rosalyn. I don&apos;t know what ya&apos;ll call her but I call her Ros, I call her Ros. That&apos;s it.  
November 19, 1997|Michael Eugene Sharp #740|Yes, I do. I would like to tell the surviving victims here, society, my family and friends, that I ask that they forgive me for anything I have done. I beg for your forgiveness. I would like to ask the Lord Jesus Christ for forgiveness and say that in spite of my circumstances, I have been blessed by Him. My first thought is that Jesus Christ came down and separated the humans from God. I would like to see that wall that separates these groups here tonight brought down and that we would all have love and compassion for one another and that you all build a future for all of us. There are a lot of men on the Row who need to be remembered. I love all&#x2026;
 March 2, 2010|Michael Adam Sigala, #999397| Yes sir, I would like to ask forgiveness of the family. I have no reason for why I did it, I don&apos;t understand why I did it. I hope that you can live the rest of your lives without hate. I pray the Lord grant me forgiveness. All powerful and almighty Lord I commit myself to thee, Amen. 
February 23, 2000| Cornelius Goss #912| I&apos;d like to apologize to the victim&apos;s family. Ah, no ah, I really can&apos;t say, I don&#x2019;t think I can say anything that will help, but I hope through your God, you can forgive me. I&apos;m definitely not the person now that I was then. I was sick, afraid, and looking for love in all the wrong ways. I&apos;ve caused you pain and grief beyond ever dreaming to cause someone of. I hope you will be able to forgive me. To my mother, I love you very much. Thanks, Jones.  
May 12, 1993|Leonel Torres Herrera #702|I am innocent, innocent, innocent. Make no mistake about this; I owe society nothing. Continue the struggle for human rights, helping those who are innocent, especially Mr. Graham. I am an innocent man, and something very wrong is taking place tonight. May God bless you all. I am ready.  
February 3, 1998|Karla Faye Tucker #777|Yes sir, I would like to say to all of you &#x2013; the Thornton family and Jerry Dean&#x2019;s family that I am so sorry. I hope God will give you peace with this.
June 4, 1997|Losada Davis #798|Yes, I do.
May 16, 2002| Ronford Styron #999124  | Yes sir, Thank you.  I love y&apos;all and I want y&apos;all to know that.  Y&apos;all always told me not to worry about myself.  I worry more about you all because I know where I am going.  I want to see you there, so get your heart right.  You know I love you and care for you.  I am going to go with my little boy and play with him.  Y&apos;all take care and I love y&apos;all.  I love y&apos;all.  Chaplain Wilcox, Roger, Robin, Sarah, Grandma.  I love you.  Y&apos;all be careful.  Lord Jesus, I see your Spirit, it&apos;s o.k.  I love you. 
 November 10, 2009|Valle, Yosvanis| I am sorry, I never wanted to kill your family. I never wanted to kill your family or these people. I am sorry for the way I talk in English. I did it to myself. I was forced to do it. I was a gang member. I never wanted to kill your brother. I was forced to do this. I blame myself. I am not going to blame nobody. I got my mother and my family too. I was forced. I tell you from my heart. I am sorry with all my heart. That&apos;s the reality of life, I am sorry. I got to pay for it. To my family, I love you, be strong. They have family too; the way they suffer is the way I am suffering. I am asking you to go and give them hugs. Please accept their hugs. Be strong in the Lord. I love you sister. I love you all, please go and try and talk to the family. I love my family. I understand why I am paying this price. Do not have any excuses for not extending your love. I am ready Warden, I am sorry everybody, I did it. Thank you brother, don&apos;t hate nobody, I feel good. I love my family, I love you Jesus. Be strong mama, I love you sister. I love Jesus. Warden I am ready. 
March 30, 1984|Ronald Clark O&#x2019;Bryan #529|What is about to transpire in a few moments is wrong! However, we as human beings do make mistakes and errors. This execution is one of those wrongs yet doesn&#x2019;t mean our whole system of justice is wrong. Therefore, I would forgive all who have taken part in any way in my death. Also, to anyone I have offended in any way during my 39 years, I pray and ask your forgiveness, just as I forgive anyone who offended me in any way. And I pray and ask God&#x2019;s forgiveness for all of us respectively as human beings. To my loved ones, I extend my undying love. To those close to me, know in your hearts I love you one and all. God bless you all and may God&#x2019;s best blessings be always yours. Ronald C. O&#x2019;Bryan P.S. During my time here, I have been treated well by all T.D.C. personnel.

September 26, 2013    |Arturo Diaz, #999345 |I don&apos;t know if you remember back in 2000, you were happy the way it happened. You were looking for me yourself and would have taken care of me yourself. I am glad it happened this way. I wouldn&apos;t want to see you in my shoes. You would have probably been here, not me. I wouldn&apos;t wish this on you. I hope this can bring some relief to you and your family. I have no hate for you.

 August 14, 2008|Michael Rodriguez| Yes I do, I know this no way makes up for all the pain and suffering I gave you. I am so so sorry. My punishment is nothing compared to the pain and sorrow I have caused. I hope that someday you can find peace. I am not strong enough to ask for forgiveness because I don&apos;t if I am worth. I realize what I&apos;ve done to you and the pain I&apos;ve given. Please Lord forgive me. I have done some horrible things. I ask the Lord to please forgive me.

 January 14, 2003|Samuel Gallamore #999090| Written: There are many things I would like to say, but none more important that how I feel toward Mr. &amp; Mrs. Kenney, and Ms. Arnott.  I would like to apologize and say I&apos;m sorry but words seem so hollow and cheap.  Their death should not have happened, but it did.  I&apos;m so sorry that all of this took place.  Now I have devastated my family as well, but my heart has grown in the last few minutes because I was forgiven by the family of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Kenney, and Ms. Arnott.  Thank You.  You have given me more hope then I have had in a long time.  If I could change things I would, not for my sake but for all those who have loved me over the years, and for those who have forgiven me.  Thank you for all that you have given me.  
November 16, 2011|Guadalupe Esparza, #999385|To the family of Alyssa Vazquez, I hope you will find peace in your heart. My sympathy goes out to you. I hope you find it in your heart to forgive me. I don&apos;t know why all of this happened.

I would like to thank Pastor Williams for counseling me and guiding me. As I look to my right and I see the family of Forest Hall. I hope this brings you closure or some type of peace. I hope it helps his family, son and loved ones. This has been a long journey, one of enlightenment. It&apos;s not the end, it&apos;s only the beginning.

 March 7, 2002|Gerald Tigner #999099| Yes.  My last statement.  I was wrongfully convicted of this crime against Michael Watkins and James Williams on 10th Street on August 31, 1993.  I got convicted on a false confession because I never admitted to it, but my lawyer did not put this out to the jury.  I did not kill those drug dealers.  I send love to my family and friends; my east side family and friends.  I am being real with the real.  That&apos;s all that counts in my heart.  I will see you later.  That&apos;s it.

I know it was a mistake. I have no one to blame but myself. It&apos;s no big deal about choosing right from wrong. I pray that everyone involved overlooks the stupidity. Everybody has problems and I won&apos;t be a part of the problem anymore. I can quit worrying now, it was all a mistake. That&apos;s all I want to say.
